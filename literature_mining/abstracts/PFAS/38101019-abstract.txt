Abstract:
In this study, the biodegradability of trifluoroacetate (TFA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluoro-2-methyl-3-oxahexanoic acid (HFPO-DA) by a native microbial community was evaluated over a 10-month incubation period. The observed microbial defluorination ratios and removal efficiency were 3.46 ( ± 2.73) % and 8.03 ( ± 3.03) %, 8.44 ( ± 1.88) % and 13.52 ( ± 4.96) %, 3.02 ( ± 0.62) % and 5.45 ( ± 2.99) % for TFA, PFOA and HFPO-DA, respectively. The biodegradation intermediate products, TFA and pentafluoropropionic acid (PFA), of PFOA and HFPO-DA were detected in their biodegradation treatment groups. Furthermore, the concentrations of the PFOA metabolites, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), in the aqueous solutions after incubation were quantified to be 0.21 and 4.14 µg/L. TFA, PFOA and HFPO-DA significantly reduced the microbial diversity and changed the structure of the community. The co-occurrence network analysis showed that low abundance species, such as Flexilinea flocculi, Bacteriovorax stolpii, and g_Sphingomonas, are positively correlated with the generation of fluoride ion, implying their potential collaborative functions contributing to the observed biodefluorination. The findings in this study can provide insights for the biodegradation of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids and their emerging alternatives by indigenous microorganisms in the environment.
