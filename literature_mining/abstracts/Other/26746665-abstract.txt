{'content': 'Promicromonospora alba sp. nov., an actinomycete isolated from the cuticle of Camponotus japonicas Mayr.\n\nA novel actinomycete, designated strain 1C-HV12T, was isolated from the cuticle of Camponotus japonicas Mayr and characterized using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that the organism should be assigned to the genus Promicromonospora and that it forms a monophyletic clade with the closest relatives Promicromonospora umidemergens JCM 17975T(99.17 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Promicromonospora vindobonensis V45T (98.88 %) and Promicromonospora iranensis HM 792T (98.85 %). Moreover, morphological and chemotaxonomic properties of strain 1C-HV12T also confirmed the affiliation of the isolate to the genus Promicromonospora. The peptidoglycan hydrolysates contained alanine, glutamic acid and lysine, and whole-cell sugars were galactose, glucose, rhamnose and ribose. The polar lipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, an unidentified phosphoglycolipid, an unidentified phospholipid and an unidentified glycolipid. The major menaquinones were MK-9(H4) and MK-9(H2). The predominant cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 0 and anteiso-C17 : 0. The DNA G+C content was 71.6 mol%. However, the low level of DNA-DNA relatedness and some phenotypic characteristics allowed the isolate to be differentiated from closely related species. Therefore, it is concluded that strain 1C-HV12T represents a novel species of the genus Promicromonospora, for which the name Promicromonospora alba sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 1C-HV12T ( = CGMCC 4.7283T = DSM 100490T).\n\nPMID:26746665', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
