{'content': 'Brevibacterium massiliense (Roux and Raoult 2009) is a later heterotypic synonym of Brevibacterium ravenspurgense (Mages, Frodl, Bernard and Funke 2009), using whole-genome sequence analysis as a comparative tool.\n\nA patient strain derived from urine was found by 16S rRNA gene sequencing to be closely related (99.6 % identity) to sequences derived from both Brevibacterium ravenspurgense CCUG 56047T and Brevibacterium massilienseCCUG 53855T. Those species had been described during the same 11 month period in 2008-2009. Further characterization revealed that those isolates could not be readily distinguished from each other biochemically, by cellular fatty acids, antimicrobial susceptibility, MALDI-TOF MS, 16S rRNA gene sequencing or by whole-genome sequence (WGS) analyses. By WGS comparison, these isolates had an aerage nucleotide identity using blastn (ANIb) scores of 95.7 % or higher to each other, DNA G+C content in the range of 62.3 mol%-62.4 mol%, with genome sizes ranging from 2.28×106 to 2.41×106 bases. Based on these data, we propose that the name B. massiliense is a later heterotypic synonym of B. ravenspurgense and provide an emended description of B. ravenspurgense.\n\nPMID:27498845', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
