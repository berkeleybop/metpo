  {'content': 'Meiothermus hypogaeus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic bacterium isolated from a hot spring.\n\nA novel moderately thermophilic, red-pigmented bacterium, designated strain AZM34c11(T), was isolated from the bottom of a 1000 m-deep drilled well located in a Japanese hot spring. Cells were Gram-negative and grew optimally at 50 °C, at pH 7.6 and with 0-0.3% (w/v) NaCl. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the isolate belonged to the genus Meiothermus. Levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain AZM34c11(T) and the type strains of recognized Meiothermus species were 88.2-94.8%. Strain AZM34c11(T) was distinguished from recognized Meiothermus species by its cellular fatty acid profile: iso-C(16:0) was one of the predominant components and hydroxy fatty acids were present only in trace amounts. The strain could also be differentiated based on its growth substrate preferences and characteristic enzyme reactions. On the basis of these results, strain AZM34c11(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Meiothermus, for which the name Meiothermus hypogaeus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AZM34c11(T) (=NBRC 106114(T) =DSM 23238(T)).\n\nPMID:21335495', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

  {'content': 'Thiomicrospira halophila sp. nov., a moderately halophilic, obligately chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur-oxidizing bacterium from hypersaline lakes.\n\nEnrichments at 2 M NaCl and pH 7.5-8, with thiosulfate or sulfide as electron donor, inoculated with sediments from hypersaline chloride-sulfate lakes of the Kulunda Steppe (Altai, Russia) resulted in the domination of two different groups of moderately halophilic, chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Under fully aerobic conditions with thiosulfate, bacteria belonging to the genus Halothiobacillus dominated while, under microaerophilic conditions, a highly motile, short vibrio-shaped phenotype outcompeted the halothiobacilli. Three genetically and phenotypically highly similar vibrio-shaped isolates were obtained in pure culture and one of them, strain HL 5(T), was identified as a member of the Thiomicrospira crunogena cluster by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The new isolates were able to grow with thiosulfate as electron donor within a broad salinity range from 0.5 to 3.5 M NaCl with an optimum at 1.5 M and within a pH range from 6.5 to 8.5 with an optimum at pH 7.5-7.8. Comparative analysis of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) gene sequences demonstrated that strain HL 5(T) possessed two genes, cbbL-1 and cbbL-2, of the form I RuBisCO and a cbbM gene of the form II RuBisCO, similar to the other members of the Thiomicrospira crunogena cluster. On the basis of phenotypic and genetic comparison, the new halophilic isolates are proposed to be placed into a novel species, Thiomicrospira halophila sp. nov. (type strain HL 5(T)=DSM 15072(T)=UNIQEM U 221(T)).\n\nPMID:17012565', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

  {'content': 'Bacillus terrae sp. nov. isolated from Cistus ladanifer rhizosphere soil.\n\nA bacterial strain designated RA9T was isolated from a root of Cistus ladanifer in Spain. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences placed the isolate into the genus Bacillus with its closest relatives being Bacillus fortis R-6514T and Bacillus fordii R-7190T with 98.2 % similarity in both cases. DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed mean relatedness values of 29 and 30 %, respectively, between strain RA9T and the type strains of B. fortis and B. fordii. Cells of the isolate were Gram-stain-positive, motile, sporulating rods. Catalase and oxidase were positive. Gelatin, starch and casein were not hydrolysed. Menaquinone MK-7 was the only menaquinone detected and iso-C15 : 0 and anteiso-C15 : 0 were the major fatty acids. The polar lipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, one unidentified aminophospholipid, one unidentified phospholipid, one unidentifed glycolipid and one unidentified lipid. meso-Diaminopimelic acid was detected in the peptidoglycan. The DNA G+C content was 43.1 mol%. Phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic analyses showed that strain RA9T should be considered as representing a novel species of the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus terrae sp. nov. is proposed.

The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization values between XY-99T and Pseudooceanicola flagellatus DY470T were 72.8 and 14.0 %, respectively, while they were 79.3 and 22.3 % between XY-99T and Pseudooceanicola nitratireducens JLT1210T. Characterization based on phylogenetic, phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genomic evidence demonstrated that XY-99T represents a novel species of the genus Pseudooceanicola, for which the name Pseudooceanicola onchidii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is XY-99T (=KCTC 72211T=MCCC 1K03607T).\n\nPMID:31778352', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

  {'content': 'Pandoraea terrae sp. nov., isolated from forest soil, and emended description of the genus Pandoraea Coenye et al. 2000.\n\nA Gram-staining-negative, facultatively aerobic, white-colony-forming bacterium, designated strain SE-S21T, was isolated from forest soil of Jeju Island in Korea. Cells were motile rods with a single polar flagellum, showing catalase- and oxidase-positive reactions. Growth was observed at 10-40 °C (optimum, 30 °C), pH 4.0-10.0 (optimum, pH 7.0-7.5) and with 0-4.0 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0-2 %). Only ubiquinone-8 was detected as the isoprenoid quinone, and C16 : 0, C17 : 0 cyclo, C19 : 1ω8c cyclo and summed feature 2 (comprising C12 : 0 aldehyde and/or unknown) were found to be the major fatty acids. Phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, an unknown aminophospholipid, an unknown aminolipid and an unknown lipid were detected as the major polar lipids. Putrescine and 2-hydroxyputrescine were the predominant polyamines. The DNA G+C content was 61.0 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA and DNA gyrase B gene sequences revealed that strain SE-S21T formed a phyletic lineage within the genus Pandoraea. Strain SE-S21T was most closely related to Pandoraea faecigallinarum KOxT and Pandoraea pnomenusa CCUG 38742T with 98.8 % and 98.7 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, respectively. However, the DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain SE-S21T and the type strains of P. faecigallinarum and P. pnomenusa were 26.6±5.7 % and 20.5±3.7 %, respectively. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular features, strain SE-S21T clearly represents a novel species of the genus Pandoraea, for which the name Pandoraea terrae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SE-S21T (=KACC 18127T=JCM 30137T). An emended description of the genus Pandoraea is also proposed.\n\nPMID:27267599', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain 11-183T formed a clade within the genus Actinophytocola, with a maximum similarity of 98.44 % to Actinophytocola xinjiangensis QAIII60T, followed by 97.76 % similarity to Actinophytocola sediminis YIM M13705T. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization values differed by 79.24 and 23.4 %, respectively, between strain 11-183T and Actinophytocolaxinjiangensis QAIII60T. Strain 11-183T grew well on N-Z-amine agar, and it produced a scant, white aerial mycelium. The isolate formed pale yellow to brown-black colonies and a dense, non-fragmented, branched substrate mycelium, and produced aerial hyphae on which nodular spore chains formed. Growth was observed at salinities ranging from 0 to 2 %, at pH values ranging from pH 6.5 to 8.0 and at temperatures ranging from 15 to 37 °C. The cell-wall amino acids included meso-diaminopimelic acid. Whole cell hydrolysates contained galactose and glucose. The principal fatty acids were iso-C16 : 0, iso-C16 : 1 H and C17 : 1ω6c. Diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine and phosphatidylethanolamine were the diagnostic phospholipids. The isoprenoid quinones included MK-9(H4) and MK-10(H4). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 71.7 mol%. Based on the genotypic and phenotypic data, we conclude that strain 11-183T belongs to a novel species of the genus Actinophytocola. The name proposed for the novel species is Actinophytocola xanthii sp. nov., with the type strain 11-183T (=KCTC 39690T= MCCC 1K02062T).\n\nPMID:28073395', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

  {'content': 'Bavariicoccus seileri gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the surface and smear water of German red smear soft cheese.\n\nThe phylogenetic position and physiological characters of six hitherto-unknown lactic acid bacterial isolates, which form part of the surface microbiota of German red smear soft cheese, are reported. The coccoid cells are aerotolerant, Gram-positive, catalase-negative and non-motile. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contains alanine, glutamic acid, lysine and aspartic acid and is of the A4alpha type (l-Lys-d-Asp). The sequences of the 16S rRNA, groEL and rpoB genes of the six isolates are identical and reveal that these isolates represent an independent lineage within the radiation of the family Enterococcaceae in the phylum Firmicutes. Their closest phylogenetic neighbour is the lactic acid bacterium Atopobacter phocae M1590/94/2(T), with which they share 94.9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity; representatives of other genera such as Granulicatella, Carnobacterium and Trichococcus are more distantly related. DNA-DNA hybridization studies reveal that the six isolates are members of a single species, and this is confirmed by similarities in biochemical characteristics. The six isolates were assigned four different groups by Fourier-transform infrared and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA typing. Therefore, it is formally proposed that these isolates should be classified in a single novel species of a novel genus and be named Bavariicoccus seileri gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Bavariicoccus seileri is WCC 4188(T) (=DSM 19936(T) =CCUG 55508(T)).\n\nPMID:19622668', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

  {'content': 'Agarilytica rhodophyticola gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from Gracilaria blodgettii.\n\nA novel Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, aerobic, agarolytic bacterium, designated 017T, was isolated from Gracilaria blodgettii collected at the coast of Lingshui county, Hainan province, China. Optimal growth occurred at 28-33 °C (range 15-40 °C), with 3 % (w/v) NaCl (range 2-4 %) and at pH 8.0 (range pH 6.5-8.5). Cells of strain 017T were motile and formed yellow colonies on marine agar 2216. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain 017T shared the highest similarity with Teredinibacter turnerae T7902T (94.4 %). The predominant polar lipids of the novel isolate consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, aminophospholipid and some other unknown lipids. Major cellular fatty acids (>10 %) were C16 : 0, C18 : 1ω7c and summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω7c/iso-C15 : 0 2-OH), and the sole respiratory lipoquinone was Q-8. The DNA G+C content of strain 017T was 40.2 mol%. Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and phenotypic characterization indicated that strain 017T represents a novel species in a new genus of the family Cellvibrionaceae, order Cellvibrionales, for which the name Agarilytica rhodophyticola gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Agarilytica rhodophyticola is 017T (=KCTC 42584T=MCCC 1H00123T).\n\nPMID:28879838', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

Caryophillidae) collected at 1500 m depth in the Avilés Canyon in the Cantabrian Sea, Asturias, Spain. Strain M-201(T) grew at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0), between 4 and 37 °C (optimum 28 °C) and at salinities of 0.5-10.5% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0.5-3.0%). The peptidoglycan contained the amino acids Lys, Ala, Thr, Glu and one unknown amino acid component, and belonged to type A4α, and the cell-wall sugars are glucose, mannose and galactose. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, an unknown phosphoglycolipid and seven unknown glycolipids. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H4) and MK-9(H6). Major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0). The genomic DNA G+C content was 72.4 mol%. The chemotaxonomic properties supported the affiliation of strain M-201(T) to the genus Myceligenerans . Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the organism was most closely related to Myceligenerans crystallogenes CD12E2-27(T) (98.2% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). However, it had a relatively low DNA-DNA relatedness value with the above strain (48%). The isolate showed antibiotic activity against Escherichia coli , Micrococcus luteus ATCC 14452 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. carlsbergensis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of antibiotic production in the genus Myceligenerans . The differences in phenotypic, metabolic, ecological and phylogenetic characteristics justify the proposal of a novel species of the genus Myceligenerans , Myceligenerans cantabricum sp. nov., with M-201(T) ( = CECT 8512(T) = DSM 28392(T)) as the type strain.\n\nPMID:25667397', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

  {'content': 'Myceligenerans cantabricum sp. nov., a barotolerant actinobacterium isolated from a deep cold-water coral.\n\nAn actinobacterium strain (M-201(T)) was isolated from a deep-sea scleractinian coral (Fam. Caryophillidae) collected at 1500 m depth in the Avilés Canyon in the Cantabrian Sea, Asturias, Spain. Strain M-201(T) grew at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0), between 4 and 37 °C (optimum 28 °C) and at salinities of 0.5-10.5% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0.5-3.0%). The peptidoglycan contained the amino acids Lys, Ala, Thr, Glu and one unknown amino acid component, and belonged to type A4α, and the cell-wall sugars are glucose, mannose and galactose. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, an unknown phosphoglycolipid and seven unknown glycolipids. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H4) and MK-9(H6). Major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0). The genomic DNA G+C content was 72.4 mol%. The chemotaxonomic properties supported the affiliation of strain M-201(T) to the genus Myceligenerans . Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the organism was most closely related to Myceligenerans crystallogenes CD12E2-27(T) (98.2% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). However, it had a relatively low DNA-DNA relatedness value with the above strain (48%). The isolate showed antibiotic activity against Escherichia coli , Micrococcus luteus ATCC 14452 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. carlsbergensis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of antibiotic production in the genus Myceligenerans . The differences in phenotypic, metabolic, ecological and phylogenetic characteristics justify the proposal of a novel species of the genus Myceligenerans , Myceligenerans cantabricum sp. nov., with M-201(T) ( = CECT 8512(T) = DSM 28392(T)) as the type strain.\n\nPMID:25667397', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
