{'content': 'Chitinimonas arctica sp. nov., isolated from Arctic tundra soil.\n\nA Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, green-pigmented, aerobic and motile bacterium, strain R3-44T, was isolated from Arctic tundra soil. Stain R3-44T clustered closely with members of the genus Chitinimonas, which belongs to the family Burkholderiaceae, and showed the highest 16S rRNA sequence similarity to Chitinimonas naiadis AR2T (96.10%). Strain R3-44T grew optimally at pH 7.0, 28 °C and in the presence of 0-0.5 % (w/v) NaCl. The predominant respiratory isoprenoid quinone of strain R3-44T was identified as ubiquinone Q-8. The polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, unidentified aminolipid and unidentified phospholipid. The main fatty acids were summed feature 3 (comprising C16 : 1 ω7c and/or C16 : 1 ω6c, 40.6 %) and C16 : 0 (29.3 %). The DNA G+C content of strain R3-44T was 60.8 mol%. On the basis of the evidence presented in this study, strain R3-44T represents a novel species of the genus Chitinimonas, for which the name Chitinimonas arctica sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain R3-44T (=CCTCC AB 2010422T=KCTC 72602T).\n\nPMID:32375945', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
