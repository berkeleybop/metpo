Hyunsoonleella ulvae sp. nov., isolated from algae in China.

A novel Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-motile, rod-shaped and yellow-pigmented bacterial strain, designated HU1-3T, was isolated from Ulva in China. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain HU1-3T represented a member of the genus Hyunsoonleella within the family Flavobacteriaceae, phylum Bacteroidota, and showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Hyunsoonleella flava T58T (97.6 %). Strain HU1-3T grew at 15-35 °C (optimum, 25-30 °C), pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and in the presence of 2-6 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 2-4 %). The draft genome of strain HU1-3T comprised 4.1 Mbp with a G+C content of 33.9mol%. Compared with the reference strain Hyunsoonleella jejuensis CNU004T, the average nucleotide identity value of strain HU1-3T was 77.9 %. The major fatty acids (>10 % of the total) were iso-C15 : 0, iso G-C15 : 1 and iso-C17 : 0 3-OH. MK-6 was the major respiratory quinone. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified aminolipids, and three unknown polar lipids. Many genes that encode glycoside hydrolases (e.g. glucosidase, xylosidase, mannosidase, galactosidase, etc.) were annotated in the genome of strain HU1-3T, which indicated that it might have the ability to degrade various kinds of polysaccharides. Given the phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic, biochemical and genomic data, strain HU1-3T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Hyunsoonleella, for which the name Hyunsoonleella ulvae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HU1-3T (=KCTC 82511T=MCCC 1K05798T).
