Non-contiguous finished genome sequence and description of Anaerococcus vaginalis.

We report the properties of a draft genome sequence of the bacterium Anaerococcus vaginalis strain PH9, a species within the Anaerococcus genus. This strain, whose genome is described here, was isolated from the fecal flora of a 26-year-old woman suffering from morbid obesity. A. vaginalis is an obligate anaerobic coccus. Here we describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence and annotation. The 2,048,125-bp long (one chromosome but no plasmid) and contains 2,095 protein-coding and 38 RNA genes, including three rRNA genes.
