## Official Conference Theme

### Main Theme:
**"Biological and Biomedical Ontologies in Action for Health, Science, and Sustainability"**

### Conference Focus Statement (from ICBO website):

"As the biomedical sciences continue to generate and rely on complex, large-scale data, ontologies remain essential for enabling semantic clarity, data integration, and interoperability. In recent years, the growing role of AI and data-driven research has further increased the demand for robust, FAIR, and sustainable ontology infrastructures.

ICBO 2025 invites contributions that explore both foundational and applied aspects of biomedical ontologies, with a **special focus on**:
- **Long-term sustainability**
- **Governance**
- **Tooling**
- **The evolving role of ontologies in AI-enabled biomedicine**"
