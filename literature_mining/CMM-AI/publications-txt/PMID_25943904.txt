Abstract

## Page 8

The xoxF gene, encoding a pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent
methanol dehydrogenase, is found in all known proteobacterial
methylotrophs. In several newly discovered methylotrophs, XoxF is
the active methanol dehydrogenase, catalysing the oxidation of
methanol to formaldehyde. Apart from that, its potential role in
methylotrophy and carbon cycling is unknown. So far, the diversity
of xoxF in the environment has received little attention. We
designed PCR primer sets targeting clades of the xoxF gene, and
used 454 pyrosequencing of PCR amplicons obtained from the DNA
of four coastal marine environments for a unique assessment of the
diversity of xoxF in these habitats. Phylogenetic analysis of the data
obtained revealed a high diversity of xoxF genes from two of the
investigated clades, and substantial differences in sequence
composition between environments. Sequences were classified as
being related to a wide range of both methylotrophs and nonmethylotrophs from Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and
Gammaproteobacteria. The most prominent sequences detected
were related to the family Rhodobacteraceae, the genus
Methylotenera and the OM43 clade of Methylophilales, and are thus
related to organisms that employ XoxF for methanol oxidation.
Furthermore, our analyses revealed a high degree of so far
undescribed sequences, suggesting a high number of unknown
bacterial species in these habitats.
