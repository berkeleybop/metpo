{'content': 'Clostridium hastiforme is a later synonym of Tissierella praeacuta.\n\nThe previously proposed species Clostridium hastiforme and Tissierella praeacuta appear to be similar from their published descriptions. Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to perform phenotypic and genetic analyses of the type strains of both species, in order to clarify their taxonomic positions. The type strains of C. hastiforme (DSM 5675(T)) and T. praeacuta (NCTC 11158(T)) exhibited identical biochemical profiles and their 16S rRNA gene sequences displayed 99.9 % similarity. DNA-DNA hybridization was also estimated to be 96.5 %. Thus, it was concluded that C. hastiforme and T. praeacuta are synonyms, where T. praeacuta has priority. An emended description of the genus Tissierella is also given.\n\nPMID:15143047', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
