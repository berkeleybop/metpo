{'content': "Genomic analysis of Hyphomonas neptunium contradicts 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analysis: implications for the taxonomy of the orders 'Rhodobacterales' and Caulobacterales.\n\nHyphomonas neptunium is a marine prosthecate alpha-proteobacterium currently classified as a member of the order 'Rhodobacterales'. Although this classification is supported by 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny, 23S rRNA gene sequence analysis, concatenated ribosomal proteins, HSP70 and EF-Tu phylogenies all support classifying Hyphomonas neptunium as a member of the Caulobacterales instead. The possible reasons why the 16S rRNA gene sequence gives conflicting results in this case are also discussed.\n\nPMID:15879228", 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
