Cell multiplication is initiated by the outgrowth of a new filament from the pole of a mature or immature cell, or from some point along a filament connecting two cells. The tip of the filament swells to form a round cell, which increases in size and eventually assumes an ovoid shape. Nonmotile, nonsporeforming, gram-negative. Contain bacteriochlorophyll, which enables them to have a photosynthetic metabolism dependent on extraneous oxidizable compounds and not accompanied by oxygen production. Contain carotenoid pigments, which give cultures a salmon-pink to a deep orange-red color, depending on the density of growth. The type species is <i>R. vannielii</i>.</s></p></content></protolog>
