METPO:1000060	metabolism	BioPortal	Metabolism	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HINO_0015266	HINO	Metabolic processes in human cells generate energy through the oxidation of molecules consumed in the diet and mediate the synthesis of diverse essential molecules not taken in the diet as well as the inactivation and elimination of toxic ones generated endogenously or present in the extracellular environment. The processes of energy metabolism can be classified into two groups according to whether they involve carbohydrate-derived or lipid-derived molecules, and within each group it is useful to distinguish processes that mediate the breakdown and oxidation of these molecules to yield energy from ones that mediate their synthesis and storage as internal energy reserves. Synthetic reactions are conveniently grouped by the chemical nature of the end products, such as nucleotides, amino acids and related molecules, and porphyrins. Detoxification reactions (biological oxidations) are likewise conveniently classified by the chemical nature of the toxin.<p>At the same time, all of these processes are tightly integrated. Intermediates in reactions of energy generation are starting materials for biosyntheses of amino acids and other compounds, broad-specificity oxidoreductase enzymes can be involved in both detoxification reactions and biosyntheses, and hormone-mediated signaling processes function to coordinate the operation of energy-generating and energy-storing reactions and to couple these to other biosynthetic processes.	0.0	1.0

For example, the way the surface of a specific PhysicalObject looks like, or the specific light of a place at a certain time, are examples of Quality, while the encoding of a Quality into e.g. a PhysicalAttribute should be modeled as a Region. 
From the design viewpoint, the Quality-Region distinction is useful only when individual aspects of an Entity are considered in a domain of discourse. 
For example, in an automotive context, it would be irrelevant to consider the aspects of car windows for a specific car, unless the factory wants to check a specific window against design parameters (anomaly detection). 
On the other hand, in an antiques context, the individual aspects for a specific piece of furniture are a major focus of attention, and may constitute the actual added value, because the design parameters for old furniture are often not fixed, and may not be viewed as 'anomalies'."	0.0	1.0

METPO:1000232	pH delta	OLS	PH Domain	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C14077	ncit	Pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains are protein modules of approximately 120 amino acids found in a wide variety of signaling proteins in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. Some PH domains bind with high affinity (low mM or nM Kd) to specific phosphoinositides such as phosphatidyl-inositol (PI) -4,5-bisphosphate, PI-3,4-P2 or PI-3,4,5-P3. Binding to phosphoinositides may allow PH proteins to respond to lipid messengers for example by relocation to membranes. The C-termini of some PH domains have also been reported to bind the beta/lambda subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins.	5.0	0.5882352941176471

Some PH domains bind with high affinity (low mM or nM Kd) to specific phosphoinositides such as phosphatidyl-inositol (PI) -4,5-bisphosphate, PI-3,4-P2 or PI-3,4,5-P3. Binding to phosphoinositides may allow PH proteins to respond to lipid messengers for example by relocation to membranes. The C-termini of some PH domains have also been reported to bind the beta/lambda subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins.	6.0	0.5263157894736843

METPO:1000335	NaCl delta	BioPortal	delta	http://sweetontology.net/realmLandCoastal/Delta	SWEET	A delta is a landform where the mouth of a river flows into an ocean, sea, desert, estuary, lake or another river. It builds up sediment outwards into the flat area which the river's flow encounters (as a deltaic deposit) transported by the water and set down as the currents slow. Deltaic deposits of larger, heavily-laden rivers are characterized by the main channel dividing amongst often substantial land masses into multiple streams known as distributaries. These divide and come together again to form a maze of active and inactive channels.	5.0	0.6666666666666667

This is then sent to a detector for measurement. The other half of the sample is injected into a combustion chamber which is raised to between 600–700 °C, some even up to 1200 °C. Here, all the carbon reacts with oxygen, forming carbon dioxide. It's then flushed into a cooling chamber, and finally into the detector. Usually, the detector used is a non-dispersive infrared spectrophotometer. By finding the total inorganic carbon and subtracting it from the total carbon content, the amount of organic carbon is determined.	14.0	0.5306122448979591

Some PH domains bind with high affinity (low mM or nM Kd) to specific phosphoinositides such as phosphatidyl-inositol (PI) -4,5-bisphosphate, PI-3,4-P2 or PI-3,4,5-P3. Binding to phosphoinositides may allow PH proteins to respond to lipid messengers for example by relocation to membranes. The C-termini of some PH domains have also been reported to bind the beta/lambda subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins.	10.0	0.5

Some PH domains bind with high affinity (low mM or nM Kd) to specific phosphoinositides such as phosphatidyl-inositol (PI) -4,5-bisphosphate, PI-3,4-P2 or PI-3,4,5-P3. Binding to phosphoinositides may allow PH proteins to respond to lipid messengers for example by relocation to membranes. The C-termini of some PH domains have also been reported to bind the beta/lambda subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins.	7.0	0.5454545454545454

METPO:1000479	NaCl delta low	BioPortal	delta	http://sweetontology.net/realmLandCoastal/Delta	SWEET	A delta is a landform where the mouth of a river flows into an ocean, sea, desert, estuary, lake or another river. It builds up sediment outwards into the flat area which the river's flow encounters (as a deltaic deposit) transported by the water and set down as the currents slow. Deltaic deposits of larger, heavily-laden rivers are characterized by the main channel dividing amongst often substantial land masses into multiple streams known as distributaries. These divide and come together again to form a maze of active and inactive channels.	9.0	0.5263157894736843

It builds up sediment outwards into the flat area which the river's flow encounters (as a deltaic deposit) transported by the water and set down as the currents slow. Deltaic deposits of larger, heavily-laden rivers are characterized by the main channel dividing amongst often substantial land masses into multiple streams known as distributaries. These divide and come together again to form a maze of active and inactive channels.	10.0	0.5

This is then sent to a detector for measurement. The other half of the sample is injected into a combustion chamber which is raised to between 600–700 °C, some even up to 1200 °C. Here, all the carbon reacts with oxygen, forming carbon dioxide. It's then flushed into a cooling chamber, and finally into the detector. Usually, the detector used is a non-dispersive infrared spectrophotometer. By finding the total inorganic carbon and subtracting it from the total carbon content, the amount of organic carbon is determined.	14.0	0.5714285714285714

""An ellipsoid is a closed type of quadric surface that is a higher dimensional analogue of an ellipse. The equation of a standard axis-aligned ellipsoid body in an xyz-Cartesian coordinate system is

    {x^2 \over a^2}+{y^2 \over b^2}+{z^2 \over c^2}=1,

where a and b are the equatorial radii (along the x and y axes) and c is the polar radius (along the z-axis), all of which are fixed positive real numbers determining the shape of the ellipsoid.

More generally, an arbitrarily oriented ellipsoid is defined by the equation

    \mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T} A \mathbf{x} = 1,

where A is a symmetric positive definite matrix and x is a vector. In that case, the eigenvectors of A define the principal directions of the ellipsoid and the inverse of the square root of the eigenvalues are the corresponding equatorial radii.""

Like a circle in two dimensions, a perfect sphere is completely symmetrical around its center, with all points on the surface lying the same distance r from the center point. This distance r is known as the radius of the sphere. The maximum straight distance through the sphere is known as the diameter of the sphere. It passes through the center and is thus twice the radius.""

After crossing the midline the two commissures fuse and project caudally synapsing with the Mauthner neuron.  As they enter the axon cap, spiral fiber neurons lose their myelin and wrap around the axon hillock in a stereotyped spiral, where they make both electrical and glutamatergic synapses on the M cell axon close to the M-cell soma and with one another. Spiral neurons produced biphasic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the contralateral M-cell  with a short latency.	6.0	0.6153846153846154

METPO:1000684	spiral shaped	BioPortal	Spiral CT	http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/xml/owl/EVS/Thesaurus.owl#C20645	NCIT	A method of computed tomography (CT) that uses continuous rotation of the X-ray tube and continuous transport of the patient through the scanning aperture that allows the rapid acquisition of a volume of CT data.  Advantages over conventional CT include: rapid acquisition of a large volume of data within a single breath-hold, thus minimizing respiration artifact and misregistration between slices; the ability to reconstruct images retrospectively at any level within the scanned volume; optimization of intravenous contrast enhancement due to the short scan times; improved multi-planar and 3-D reconstruction; and the potential for radiation dose reduction.  Same as helical computed tomography. (British Journal of Radiology 1994 May;67(797):436-44)	6.0	0.6363636363636364

After crossing the midline the two commissures fuse and project caudally synapsing with the Mauthner neuron.  As they enter the axon cap, spiral fiber neurons lose their myelin and wrap around the axon hillock in a stereotyped spiral, where they make both electrical and glutamatergic synapses on the M cell axon close to the M-cell soma and with one another. Spiral neurons produced biphasic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the contralateral M-cell  with a short latency.	6.0	0.6153846153846154

Irregular bones serve various purposes in the body, such as protection of nervous tissue, affording multiple anchor points for skeletal muscle attachment (as with the sacrum), and maintaining pharynx and trachea support, and tongue attachment (such as the hyoid bone). They consist of cancellous tissue enclosed within a thin layer of compact bone. The irregular bones are: the vertebrC&, sacrum, coccyx, temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid, zygomatic, maxilla, mandible, palatine, inferior nasal concha, and hyoid.	5.0	0.7333333333333334

METPO:1000697	gram stain	OLS	gram stain	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_23014	aro	Gram staining is a method for staining and identifying bacteria. It is based on the differential retention of a crystal violet-iodine complex within the cell membrane. The cell wall of gram-positive cells have a thick peptidoglycan layer that retains crystal violet after an alcohol wash (staining black-blue or purple by a counterstain). The cell wall of gram-negative cells have a thinner peptidoglycan layer that does not retain crystal violet after an alcohol wash (staining red after counterstain). Some cells have variable staining in culture (e.g. Bacillus, Clostridium) while others have indeterminate staining due to unique aspects of their cell membrane or wall (e.g. Mycobacterium, Mycoplasma).	0.0	1.0

METPO:1000697	gram stain	BioPortal	gram stain	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_23014	ARO	Gram staining is a method for staining and identifying bacteria. It is based on the differential retention of a crystal violet-iodine complex within the cell membrane. The cell wall of gram-positive cells have a thick peptidoglycan layer that retains crystal violet after an alcohol wash (staining black-blue or purple by a counterstain). The cell wall of gram-negative cells have a thinner peptidoglycan layer that does not retain crystal violet after an alcohol wash (staining red after counterstain). Some cells have variable staining in culture (e.g. Bacillus, Clostridium) while others have indeterminate staining due to unique aspects of their cell membrane or wall (e.g. Mycobacterium, Mycoplasma).	0.0	1.0

METPO:1000700	gram variable	BioPortal	Variable	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Variable	OCS	A variable is a concept or characteristic whose value or attribute changes or varies from one case to another, or across different individuals, groups, situations, or over time. It is a dimension along which an object, individual, or group can be categorised or measured, allowing for specific comparisons to be made with others or across different points in time. Examples of variables in sociological research include income level (which can vary from person to person), age (which changes over time for an individual), educational attainment (which differs among individuals), or social class (which can vary across groups or societies). Researchers examine the relationships between different variables to understand social phenomena, test hypotheses, and develop sociological theories. Variables can be independent (the presumed cause) or dependent (the presumed effect) in a causal relationship.	5.0	0.7619047619047619

METPO:1000721	extreme hyperthermophilic	OLS	extreme ultraviolet lithography	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHMO_0001422	chmo	A synthesis method that uses light to transfer a pattern to a substrate. A solution of photoresist (a polymer) is deposited on the substrate by spin coating. The photoresist-coated substrate is then heated to drive off excess solvent ('soft-baked', 'prebaked', 'post-application baked', PAB), typically at 90–100 °C. The photoresist is then exposed to a pattern of intense EUV (13.5 nm) light in a vacuum. A post-exposure bake (PEB) at 120–180 °C is performed before immersing the substrate in a 'developer' which removes excess photoresist. Positive photoresist becomes soluble in the developer when exposed; negative photoresist becomes insoluble in the developer. Finally the substrate is baked again ('hard-baked') to solidify the remaining photoresist.	21.0	0.5

METPO:1000882	cell width	OLS	Red cell distribution width	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0009188	efo	Red blood cell distribution width (RDW or RDW-CV or RCDW and RDW-SD) is a measure of the range of variation of red blood cell (RBC) volume that is reported as part of a standard complete blood count. Usually red blood cells are a standard size of about 6-8 μm in diameter. Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal reference range of RDW-CV in human red blood cells is 11.5-14.5%.[1] If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) results to determine the possible causes of the anemia. It is mainly used to differentiate an anemia of mixed causes from an anemia of a single cause.	17.0	0.5405405405405406

Usually red blood cells are a standard size of about 6-8 μm in diameter. Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal reference range of RDW-CV in human red blood cells is 11.5-14.5%.[1] If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) results to determine the possible causes of the anemia. It is mainly used to differentiate an anemia of mixed causes from an anemia of a single cause.	17.0	0.5405405405405406

METPO:1001000	observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	0.0	1.0

METPO:1001000	observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	0.0	1.0

METPO:1001004	temperature delta observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	18.0	0.55

METPO:1001004	temperature delta observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	18.0	0.55

METPO:1001007	growth NaCl observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	12.0	0.6470588235294117

METPO:1001007	growth NaCl observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	12.0	0.6470588235294117

METPO:1001008	NaCl delta observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	11.0	0.6666666666666667

METPO:1001008	NaCl delta observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	11.0	0.6666666666666667

METPO:1001009	NaCl range observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	11.0	0.6666666666666667

METPO:1001009	NaCl range observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	11.0	0.6666666666666667

METPO:1001010	optimum NaCl observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	13.0	0.6285714285714286

METPO:1001010	optimum NaCl observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	13.0	0.6285714285714286

METPO:1001012	growth pH observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	10.0	0.6875

METPO:1001012	growth pH observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	10.0	0.6875

METPO:1001013	optimum pH observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	11.0	0.6666666666666667

METPO:1001013	optimum pH observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	11.0	0.6666666666666667

METPO:1001014	pH delta observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	9.0	0.7096774193548387

METPO:1001014	pH delta observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	9.0	0.7096774193548387

METPO:1001015	pH range observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	9.0	0.7096774193548387

METPO:1001015	pH range observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	9.0	0.7096774193548387

Quantitative observations can be about a [[StatisticalVariable]], which is an abstract specification about which we can make observations that are grounded at a particular location and time.

Observations can also encode a subset of simple RDF-like statements (its observationAbout, a StatisticalVariable, defining the measuredPoperty; its observationAbout property indicating the entity the statement is about, and [[value]] )

In the context of a quantitative knowledge graph, typical properties could include [[measuredProperty]], [[observationAbout]], [[observationDate]], [[value]], [[unitCode]], [[unitText]], [[measurementMethod]].

METPO:1001016	optimum oxygen observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	15.0	0.5945945945945945

METPO:1001016	optimum oxygen observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	15.0	0.5945945945945945

METPO:1001017	growth oxygen observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations.

METPO:1001017	growth oxygen observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	14.0	0.6111111111111112

METPO:1001018	oxygen range observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	13.0	0.6285714285714286

METPO:1001018	oxygen range observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	13.0	0.6285714285714286

METPO:1001019	oxygen delta observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	13.0	0.6285714285714286

METPO:1001019	oxygen delta observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	13.0	0.6285714285714286

METPO:1001020	oxygen observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	7.0	0.7586206896551724

METPO:1001020	oxygen observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	7.0	0.7586206896551724

METPO:1001021	temperature observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	12.0	0.6470588235294117

METPO:1001021	temperature observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	12.0	0.6470588235294117

METPO:1001022	NaCl observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	5.0	0.8148148148148149

METPO:1001022	NaCl observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations. This method allows for the collection of rich, detailed data about social life as it unfolds.	5.0	0.8148148148148149

METPO:1001023	pH observation	BioPortal	observation	http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/HL7/C1554188	HL7	**Description:**An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The<b>code</b>attribute of Observation and the<b>value</b>attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<b>Discussion:</b><p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.</p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.</p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.</p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.</p><p>Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.</p><b>Examples:</b><p>* Recording the results of a Family History Assessment * Laboratory test and associated result * Physical exam test and associated result * Device temperature * Soil lead level</p>	3.0	0.88

METPO:1001023	pH observation	BioPortal	Observation	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/OCS/data/#Observation	OCS	Observation is a fundamental research technique in which an investigator systematically collects information and data through direct participation in and/or observation of a group, tribe, community, or social setting being studied. This method is often used in qualitative research, particularly in ethnography and field studies, to gain an in-depth understanding of social behaviours, interactions, and cultural practices in their natural context. Researchers may choose to be participant observers, actively engaging in the activities of the group while also observing, or non-participant observers, observing from a distance without directly participating. Systematic observation involves developing a focused research question, defining what will be observed, and using a structured approach to record and analyse the observations.

Through one sub-pathway (oxidative route), glycerol is dehydrogenated by an NAD+-linked glycerol dehydrogenase (DhaD) to dihydroxyacetone. This product is then phosphorylated by dihydroxyacetone kinase (DhaK) and funnelled to the central metabolism. Through the other sub-pathway (reductive route), glycerol is dehydrated by coenzyme B12-dependent glycerol dehydratase (DhaB, DhaC, DhaE) to form 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde, which is reduced to the major fermentation product 1,3-propanediol by the NADH-linked 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase (DhaT), thereby regenerating NAD+ [PMID: 9311132].	9.0	0.7272727272727273
