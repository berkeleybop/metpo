Abstract
The legume symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium, B. diazoefficiens
strain USDA110, utilizes methanol for growth in the presence of
light lanthanides, such as La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+ or Nd3+, and its cells
possess significant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) activity. We
purified MDH to homogeneity from B. diazoefficiens strain
USDA110 grown in a methanol/Ce3+ medium; the protein was
identified as XoxF5-type MDH (blr6213). The purified XoxF
contained 0.58 cerium atoms per enzyme subunit. Moreover, the insolution structure of XoxF was analyzed by small angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) analysis; the radius of gyration (Rg) and
maximum particle dimension (Dmax) of XoxF were calculated to be
32.3 and 96.8 Å, respectively, suggesting that XoxF adopts a dimer
structure in solution. These results show that B. diazoefficiens strain
USDA110 has XoxF, a lanthanides-dependent MDH, which has

methanol oxidation activity and is induced by methanol/
lanthanaides, and that lanthanide is one of the important factors in
methanol utilization by the strain.
Keywords: Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens; Lanthanide, XoxF;
Methanol dehydrogenase; Methanol utilization.
