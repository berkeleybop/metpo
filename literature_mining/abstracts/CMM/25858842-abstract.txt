Abstract:
Methylobacterium species colonize plant surfaces and utilize methanol emitted from plants. Methylobacterium aquaticum strain 22A was isolated from a hydroponic culture of a moss, Racomitrium japonicum, and is a potent plant growth promoter. The complete genome sequencing of the strain confirmed the presence of genes related to plant growth promotion and methylotrophy.
