Neoscardovia arbecensis gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from porcine slurries.

Three Gram-positive, anaerobic, pleomorphic strains (PG10(T), PG18 and PG22), were selected among five strains isolated from pig slurries while searching for host specific bifidobacteria to track the source of fecal pollution in water. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed a maximum identity of 94% to various species of the family Bifidobacteriaceae. However, phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA and HSP60 gene sequences revealed a closer relationship of these strains to members of the recently described Aeriscardovia, Parascardovia and Scardovia genera, than to other Bifidobacterium species. The names Neoscardovia gen. nov. and Neoscardovia arbecensis sp. nov. are proposed for a new genus and for the first species belonging to this genus, respectively, and for which PG10(T) (CECT 8111(T), DSM 25737(T)) was designated as the type strain. This new species should be placed in the Bifidobacteriaceae family within the class Actinobacteria, with Aeriscardovia aeriphila being the closest relative. The prevailing cellular fatty acids were C(16:0) and C(18:1)ω9c, and the major polar lipids consisted of a variety of glycolipids, diphosphatidyl glycerol, two unidentified phospholipids, and phosphatidyl glycerol. The peptidoglycan structure was A1γmeso-Dpm-direct. The GenBank accession numbers for the 16S rRNA gene and HSP60 gene sequences of strains PG10(T), PG18 and PG22 are JF519691, JF519693, JQ767128 and JQ767130, JQ767131, JQ767133, respectively.
