# Project Status Report: Exploring OLS Embeddings

This document outlines the objective, progress, and remaining tasks for the project of exploring the OLS embeddings database.

## Objective

The primary goal is to perform a similarity search against the OLS embeddings stored in the `embeddings.db` SQLite database. This involves:

1.  Formulating a text query.
2.  Generating an embedding for the query using the `text-embedding-3-small` OpenAI model.
3.  Connecting to the `embeddings.db` database.
4.  Calculating the cosine similarity between the query embedding and the embeddings stored in the database.
5.  Identifying the most similar entries in the database.

## Progress Made

- **Database Analyzed:** We have successfully identified the location and structure of the `embeddings.db` file. We know it contains a table named `embeddings` with columns such as `ontologyId`, `iri`, `document`, and `embeddings`.
- **Jupyter Notebook Created:** A new notebook, `notebooks/explore_embeddings.ipynb`, has been created. It contains the Python code required to perform the end-to-end similarity search.
- **Dependencies Identified:** The necessary Python packages for this task have been identified: `openai`, `numpy`, `python-dotenv`, `jupyter`, and `notebook`.
- **Project Configuration Updated:** The `pyproject.toml` file has been updated to include `numpy` in the `[project.optional-dependencies].notebooks` section, ensuring all required packages are declared.

## Remaining Tasks

1.  **Install Dependencies:** The required Python packages must be installed into the `uv` virtual environment.
2.  **Run Notebook:** Launch the Jupyter notebook server and execute the code in `notebooks/explore_embeddings.ipynb` to verify that:
    - The OpenAI API key is correctly loaded.
    - A query embedding can be generated.
    - The connection to the SQLite database is successful.
    - A similarity search can be executed.

## Current Blocker

The immediate next step is to **install the declared dependencies** into the environment. We have not yet settled on the correct `uv` command to accomplish this based on the project's `pyproject.toml` file.
