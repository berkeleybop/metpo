The following description is based on previously published data concerning the genus (1) and on our own work with 10 strains from six of the continental United States; all studies included the type strain. Cells are straight rods, usually within the range of 0.4 to 0.7 μm wide by 0.7 to 1.8 μm long. Gram negative. Motile by a single polar flagellum. Obligately aerobic. Optimum growth temperature is 30°C, with no growth above 38°C. On agar plates, colonies are circular, raised, semitranslucent, and yellow and the margins are entire. The pigments are brominated aryl polyenes or xanthomonadins, and crude methanol extractions of the pigments exhibit a major absorption peak between 443 and 446 nm. Able to use a variety of carbohydrates and salts of organic acids as sole carbon sources. No amino acids required for growth. Growth on minimal media greatly stimulated by addition of glutamic acid. Starch and casein hydrolysis positive; lipolysis of Tween 80. No evidence of pectinase activity in culture (cf. Table 1). Distinguished from <i>X. campestris</i> and <i>X. citri</i> by distinct patterns of hybridizing DNA bands by RFLP analyses (cf. Fig. 2). Isolated from bean (<i>P. vulgaris</i> L.) plants showing a systemic blight disease of leaves and pods. The type strain is G27, deposited in the American Type Culture Collection as ATCC 49119.</s></p></content></protolog>
