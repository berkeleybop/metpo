# Background for ICBO 2025 Talk on METPO and CMM

## Official Meaning of CMM

The acronym **CMM** stands for **Critical Minerals and Materials**. This term is used officially by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), especially in the context of initiatives focused on securing domestic supply chains for critical materials required in energy and environmental technologies.

Multiple sources, including DOE budget documents and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) publications, confirm this interpretation.

**Key Sources:**
- [DOE CMM Program Portal](https://www.energy.gov/science/critical-minerals-and-materials-program)
- DOE BER Budget References mentioning *critical minerals and materials (CMM)*
- LBNL Earth & Environmental Sciences documentation on CMM research

## Key People and Roles

### Marcin Joachimiak (LBNL)
- Computational biologist and PI for the **KG-Microbe** project
- Leads ontology, knowledge graph, and AI/ML work under CMM
- Developer of METPO and key contributor to microbial data integration and prediction efforts

### N. Cecilia Martinez-Gomez (UC Berkeley)
- Microbiologist specializing in **lanthanide-dependent methylotrophy**
- Leads experimental research on microbial metabolism and elemental cycling
- Collaborates on the integration of metabolic traits into KG-Microbe

## KG-Microbe Applications

**KG-Microbe** is a large-scale knowledge graph developed under the CMM project. It integrates data on microbial traits, functions, environments, and taxonomic information. Its primary applications include:

### 1. Predicting Optimal Growth Media
- ML models trained on KG-Microbe data accurately predict which media a given microbe will grow on
- Explainable rule-based models and black-box ML approaches both showed over 70% precision in benchmark datasets

### 2. Microbial Trait Prediction
- Graph embeddings were used to infer traits such as cell shape or metabolic strategy for uncultivated microbes

### 3. Hypothesis Generation
- Multi-hop queries and vector algebra enabled discovery of previously unknown trait associations and potential microbial interactions
