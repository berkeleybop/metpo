{'content': 'Mycobacterium saskatchewanense sp. nov., a novel slowly growing scotochromogenic species from human clinical isolates related to Mycobacterium interjectum and Accuprobe-positive for Mycobacterium avium complex.\n\nA pigmented, slowly growing Mycobacterium avium complex AccuProbe-positive organism was isolated from the sputum and pleural fluid of a 72-year-old female with bronchiectasis. The unusual morphology of the organism prompted further identification by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, revealing a perfect identity with previously uncharacterized strain Mycobacterium sp. MCRO 8 (GenBank accession no. X93034), with the closest established species by 16S rDNA analysis being Mycobacterium interjectum. HPLC of the organism corresponded to previously obtained patterns identified as M. interjectum-like and, upon sequence evaluation of a selection of strains with a similar profile, more were subsequently identified as MCRO 8. A total of 16 strains isolated from human respiratory samples were evaluated in the characterization of this novel species, for which the name Mycobacterium saskatchewanense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain 00-250(T) (=ATCC BAA-544(T)=DSM 44616(T)=CIP 108114(T)).\n\nPMID:15143004', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
