  Abstract:
  Only three biological pathways are known to produce oxygen: photosynthesis, chlorate respiration and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Here we present evidence for a fourth pathway, possibly of considerable geochemical and evolutionary importance. The pathway was discovered after metagenomic sequencing of an enrichment culture that couples anaerobic oxidation of methane with the reduction of nitrite to dinitrogen. The complete genome of the dominant bacterium, named 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera', was assembled. This apparently anaerobic, denitrifying bacterium encoded, transcribed and expressed the well-established aerobic pathway for methane oxidation, whereas it lacked known genes for dinitrogen production. Subsequent isotopic labelling indicated that 'M. oxyfera' bypassed the denitrification intermediate nitrous oxide by the conversion of two nitric oxide molecules to dinitrogen and oxygen, which was used to oxidize methane. These results extend our understanding of hydrocarbon degradation under anoxic conditions and explain the biochemical mechanism of a poorly understood freshwater methane sink. Because nitrogen oxides were already present on early Earth, our finding opens up the possibility that oxygen was available to microbial metabolism before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  pmid: <PubMed ID of the article>
  study_taxa: <Main bacterial or archaeal taxa studied>
  strains: <Extract strain designations WITHOUT genus/species prefixes. Remove terminal "T" or "(T)" suffixes indicating type strain status. Examples: "DSM 12345T" becomes "DSM 12345", "strain ABC" becomes "ABC".>
  strain_to_taxon: <Extract strain-to-species relationships using exactly the same strain identifiers from the strains field above. Connect each strain to its parent taxon.>
  strain_to_phenotype: <Extract ALL strain-phenotype relationships mentioned in the text. Be COMPREHENSIVE - do not omit any phenotypes. Use EXACTLY the same strain identifiers from the strains field above.
  OUTPUT FORMAT: semicolon-separated on a single line. DO NOT use YAML list format with dashes (-).
  Example: 017 has_phenotype rod-shaped; 017 has_phenotype Gram-negative; 017 has_phenotype motile
  Extract phenotypes including: cell shape (rod-shaped, coccus-shaped, spiral, curved), Gram staining (Gram-positive, Gram-negative, Gram-stain-negative, Gram-variable), motility (motile, non-motile, flagellated), oxygen requirements (aerobic, anaerobic, facultatively_anaerobic, microaerophilic), temperature preferences (mesophilic, thermophilic, psychrophilic), pH preferences (acidophilic, alkaliphilic, neutrophilic), salinity tolerance (halophilic), and pigmentation colors.>
  strain_to_medium: <Extract ALL strain-medium relationships mentioned in the text. Use EXACTLY the same strain identifiers from the strains field above.
  For example: 017 grows_on_medium marine_agar_2216; MG1655 grows_on_medium LB; K12 requires_medium R2A; StrainXYZ grows_on_medium TSA
  Include standard media names (TSA, R2A, LB, nutrient agar, marine agar) and specific formulations mentioned.>
