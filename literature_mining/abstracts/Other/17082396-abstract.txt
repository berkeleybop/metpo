{'content': 'Nesterenkonia jeotgali sp. nov., isolated from jeotgal, a traditional Korean fermented seafood.\n\nA Gram-positive, non-motile, slightly halophilic actinomycete, strain JG-241T, was isolated from jeotgal, a traditional Korean fermented seafood, and its taxonomic position was investigated by using a polyphasic approach. Strain JG-241T grew optimally at 25-30 degrees C and in the presence of 2-5% (w/v) NaCl. The physiological and biochemical properties of strain JG-241T were distinguishable from those of recognized Nesterenkonia species. Strain JG-241T had a peptidoglycan type based on L-lys-gly-D-Asp. It contained MK-7, MK-8 and MK-9 as the predominant menaquinones and anteiso-C15:0) and anteiso-C17:0 as the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and an unidentified glycolipid. The DNA G+C content was 68.0 mol%. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain JG-241T falls within the radiation of the cluster comprising Nesterenkonia species. Similarity values between the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain JG-241T and those of the type strains of Nesterenkonia species ranged from 96.7 to 99.7%. DNA-DNA relatedness data and repetitive extragenic palindromic DNA-PCR genomic fingerprinting patterns showed that strain JG-241T differs genetically from recognized Nesterenkonia species. On the basis of its phenotypic properties and phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness, strain JG-241T represents a novel species of the genus Nesterenkonia, for which the name Nesterenkonia jeotgali sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JG-241T (=KCTC 19053T=JCM 12610T).\n\nPMID:17082396', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
