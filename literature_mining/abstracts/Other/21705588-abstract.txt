Abstract:
We present the genome of Salinisphaera shabanensis, isolated from a brine-seawater interface and representing a new order within the Gammaproteobacteria. Its adaptations to physicochemical and nutrient availability fluctuations include six genes encoding heavy metal-translocating P-type ATPases and multiple genes involved in iron uptake, siderophore production, and poly-Î²-hydroxybutyrate synthesis.
