{'content': 'Planktotalea arctica sp. nov., isolated from Arctic seawater.\n\nA Gram-staining-negative, non-motile, non-pigmented, rod-shaped bacterium was isolated from an Arctic coastal seawater sample and was designated strain IMCC9565T. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain IMCC9565T revealed that the closest phylogenetic neighbours of the strain were members of the genus Planktotalea. Furthermore, the strain formed a robust clade with Planktotalea frisia SH6-1T, with which it shared 97.9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. Determination of genomic relatedness based on average nucleotide identity and genome-to-genome distance showed that strain IMCC9565T was distantly related to P. frisia, meaning the Arctic strain represents a novel species. Optimum growth of strain IMCC9565T was observed at 20 °C, pH 7.0 and in the presence of 2 % (w/v) NaCl. The major respiratory isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone-10 (Q-10) and the major polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, one unidentified aminolipid and two unidentified lipids. The principal fatty acids were C18 : 1ω7c and/or C18 : 1ω6c, C18 : 1ω7c 11-methyl and C16 : 0, and the DNA G+C content was 57.1 mol%. Based on these data, Planktotalea arctica sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate the bacterial isolate and the type strain is IMCC9565T (=KACC 18009T=NBRC 110393T).\n\nPMID:28840817', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
