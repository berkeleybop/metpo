{'content': 'Skermanella stibiiresistens sp. nov., a highly antimony-resistant bacterium isolated from coal-mining soil, and emended description of the genus Skermanella.\n\nA Gram-negative, aerobic, motile, rod-shaped, antimony-resistant bacterium, designated strain SB22(T), was isolated from soil of Jixi coal mine, China. The major cellular fatty acids (>5 %) were C(18:1)Ï‰7c (63.5 %), summed feature 2 (C(14:0) 3-OH and/or iso-C(16:1) I, 10.8 %) and C(16:0) (9.9 %). The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and an unknown aminolipid. The genomic DNA G+C content was 69.6 mol% and Q-10 was the major respiratory quinone. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain SB22(T) was most closely related to Skermanella aerolata 5416T-32(T) (97.3 %), Skermanella parooensis ACM 2042(T) (95.8 %) and Skermanella xinjiangensis 10-1-101(T) (92.9 %). The DNA-DNA hybridization value between strain SB22(T) and S. aerolata KACC 11604(T) ( = 5416T-32(T)) was 43.3 %. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic characteristics of strain SB22(T) and related species, it is considered that the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Skermanella, for which the name Skermanella stibiiresistens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SB22(T) ( = CGMCC 1.10751(T) = KCTC 23364(T)). An emended description of the genus Skermanella is provided.\n\nPMID:21784960', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
