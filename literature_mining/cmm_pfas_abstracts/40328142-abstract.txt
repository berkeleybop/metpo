{'content': 'Lanthanide(III)-dependent hydration of the methanol dehydrogenase cofactor, pyrroloquinoline quinone.\n\nThe mechanism by which pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent methanol dehydrogenases (MDH), bearing either a Ca2+ or a lanthanide (Ln3+) ion in their active site, oxidize methanol has been intensely debated. In particular, the Ln3+-dependent activity of Ln-MDH remains poorly understood. The lack of experimental evidence represents a significant limitation to improve our understanding of these enzymes. In this work, we propose that insights on Ca- and Ln-MDH reactivity can be gained by examining a model reaction, the hydration of PQQ. Indeed, this reaction is similar to the first step of the putative methanol addition-elimination mechanism and is expected to be similarly influenced by the metal ion. The apparent affinity constants of PQQ for Ca2+ and Ln3+ were determined by UVvis absorption spectroscopy. Ln-PQQ complexes in aqueous solution were analyzed by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters describing the equilibrium were obtained by variable-temperature and proton exchange spectroscopy (EXSY) NMR, as well as DFT calculations. Results demonstrated a Ln-dependent exchange rate for PQQ hydration equilibrium, the late and more Lewis acidic Ln3+ having the stronger impact.\n\nPMID:40328142', 'saved_to': None, 'truncated': False}
