Phylogeny of human intestinal spirochaetes inferred from 16S rDNA sequence comparisons.

The sequence of 1383 nucleotides of the DNA encoding 16S rDNA was determined for strains of human intestinal spirochaetes, comprising an unnamed isolate and "Brachyspira aalborgi" NCTC 11492. A phylogenetic tree was inferred from aligned sequence comparisons between the intestinal spirochaetes, representatives of the Spirochaetales and Escherichia coli. The type strain of Brachyspira aalborgi, though related to the Serpulina spp. at approx. 96.5% sequence similarity was distinct and separated from the unnamed human intestinal isolate, HIS Oman, N26. The latter formed a separated and novel lineage that bisected the Spirochaetales.
