{'content': 'Nonomuraea jabiensis sp. nov., isolated from arid soil.\n\nA novel actinomycete, strain A4036(T), was isolated from a soil sample collected from the Jabi district in Abuja, Nigeria. The taxonomic position of strain A4036(T) was established using a combination of genotypic and phenotypic analyses. The organism formed extensively branched substrate and aerial hyphae that generated spiral chains of spores with warty surfaces. The cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid and the cell-wall sugars were glucose, madurose, mannose and ribose. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H(4)). The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, hydroxy-phosphatidylethanolamine, hydroxy-phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, two unidentified phospholipids and four unknown glucosamine-containing phospholipids. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C(16 : 0) 2-OH, iso-C(16 : 0) and 10-methyl C(17 : 0). On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity studies, strain A4036(T) grouped in the genus Nonomuraea, being most closely related to Nonomuraea angiospora IFO 13155(T) (99.05 %), Nonomuraea candida HMC10(T) (98.78 %), Nonomuraea kuesteri GW 14-1925(T) (98.49 %), Nonomuraea endophytica YIM 65601(T) (98.42 %), Nonomuraea maheshkhaliensis 16-5-14(T) (98.40 %), Nonomuraea turkmeniaca DSM 43926(T) (98.38 %), Nonomuraea helvata IFO 14681(T) (98.29 %), Nonomuraea rubra DSM 43768(T) (98.10 %) and Nonomuraea salmonea DSM 43678(T) (98.06 %). Levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to the type strains of other species of the genus Nonomuraea were <98 %. Despite the high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, DNA-DNA relatedness values and phenotypic data demonstrated that strain A4036(T) was clearly distinguished from all closely related species of the genus Nonomuraea. Thus, this isolate is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Nonomuraea, for which the name Nonomuraea jabiensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is A4036(T) (= DSM 45507(T) = KCTC 19870(T)).\n\nPMID:22389281', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
