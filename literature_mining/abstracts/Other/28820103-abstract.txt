{'content': 'Two novel Lipomycetaceous yeast species, Lipomyces okinawensis sp. nov. and Lipomyces yamanashiensis f.a., sp. nov., isolated from soil in the Okinawa and Yamanashi prefectures, Japan.\n\nFour novel Lipomyces strains were isolated from soil collected in the Okinawa and Yamanashi prefectures, Japan. Based on their morphological and biochemical characteristics, along with sequence typing using the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rRNA, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region including 5.8S rRNA, and translation elongation factor 1 alpha gene (EF-1Î±), the four strains were shown to represent two novel species of the genus Lipomyces, described as Lipomyces okinawensis sp. nov. (type strain No.3-a(35)T=NBRC 110620T=CBS 14747T) and Lipomyces yamanashiensis f.a., sp. nov. (type strain No.313T=NBRC 110621T=CBS 14748T).\n\nPMID:28820103', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
