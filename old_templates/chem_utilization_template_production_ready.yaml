          semicolon-separated list of ALL organism-compound relationships found in the text.
          Extract every instance where an organism interacts with a chemical compound.
          Include both positive relationships (ferments, produces, utilizes, reduces, etc.)
          and negative relationships (does not ferment, cannot utilize, etc.).
          Look for patterns like:
          - "bacterium fermented glucose"
          - "strain produces hydrogen"  
          - "organism reduces sulfate"
          - "species does not utilize citrate"
          - "cells contain fatty acids"
