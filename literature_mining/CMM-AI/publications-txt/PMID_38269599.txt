Abstract
Artificial dye-coupled assays have been widely adopted as a rapid
and convenient method to assess the activity of methanol
dehydrogenases (MDH). Lanthanide(Ln)-dependent XoxF-MDHs are
able to incorporate different lanthanides (Lns) in their active site.
Dye-coupled assays showed that the earlier Lns exhibit a higher
enzyme activity than the late Lns. Despite widespread use, there are
limitations: oftentimes a pH of 9 and activators are required for the
assay. Moreover, Ln-MDH variants are not obtained by isolation
from the cells grown with the respective Ln, but by incubation of an
apo-MDH with the Ln. Herein, we report the cultivation of Lndependent methanotroph Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV
with nine different Lns, the isolation of the respective MDHs and
the assessment of the enzyme activity using the dye-coupled assay.
We compare these results with a protein-coupled assay using its
physiological electron acceptor cytochrome cGJ (cyt cGJ ).
Depending on the assay, two distinct trends are observed among the
Ln series. The specific enzyme activity of La-, Ce- and Pr-MDH, as
measured by the protein-coupled assay, exceeds that measured by
the dye-coupled assay. This suggests that early Lns also have a
positive effect on the interaction between XoxF-MDH and its cyt cGJ
thereby increasing functional efficiency.
Keywords: lanthanide-dependent bacteria; lanthanides;
metalloenzymes; methanol dehydrogenase; methylotrophy.
