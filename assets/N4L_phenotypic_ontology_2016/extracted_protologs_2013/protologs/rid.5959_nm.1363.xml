N.L. gen. n. <em>chomelii</em> in honour of Bruno B. Chomel, who was the first to experimentally demonstrate the transmission of <em>Bartonella henselae</em> by fleas in cats, and to isolate <em>Bartonella bovis</em> from domestic cattle. His studies on <em>Bartonella</em> infection in animals contributed to an improved understanding of epidemiology and vectors of <em>Bartonella</em>-associated disease in animals.)</s></p><p class="description"><s>Colonies, grown on rabbit blood agar, appeared homogeneous, smooth, round and grey–white.</s><s>Electron microscopic examination revealed small bacilli with unipolar flagellae.</s><s>A primary culture strain of <em>Bartonella chomelii</em> was obtained after 10 days incubation at 35 °C in a moist atmosphere containing 5 % CO<sub>2</sub>.</s><s>A subculture on blood agar was obtained after 6 days culture under the same conditions.</s><s>The two strains tested were oxidase- and catalase-negative, had negative Voges–Proskauer reactions and had a positive reaction to tributyrin.</s><s>Amino acid arylamidase activity was obtained with the following amino acids: arginine (ArgA), proline (ProA), phenylalanine (PheA), leucine (LeuA), tyrosine (TyrA), alanine (AlaA) and glycine (GlyA).</s><s>The new species was distinguished from other <em>Bartonella</em> species by its 16S rRNA gene and <em>gltA</em> gene 3′ end sequences as well as by whole-DNA hybridization.</s><s>The type strain, A828<sup>T</sup> (isolated from the blood of <em>Bos taurus</em>), has been deposited in the CIP, Paris, France (CIP 107869<sup>T</sup>) and in the Culture Collection of the University of Göteborg, Sweden (CCUG 47497).</s></p></content></protolog>
