This designation is predicated upon the susceptibility of the organisms to ampicillin and carbenicillin, which first led us to suspect that the organisms were a separate group of aeromonads.</s></p><p class="description"><s>We propose the name <i>Aeromonas trota</i> for the 13 strains listed in Table 1 (21).</s><s>The type strain of the species is designated ATCC 49657<sup>T</sup> (formerly AH2), and a complete description of all of the strains is provided in Table 2.</s><s>The unique profile of <i>A. trota</i> includes negative reactions for esculin hydrolysis arabinose fermentation, Voges-Proskauer test, and gluconate oxidation.</s><s>Further, <i>A. trota</i> is positive for cellobiose fermentation, lysine decarboxylation, and citrate utilization but is susceptible to both ampicillin and carbenicillin.</s><s>A comparison of this profile with those of other mesophilic <i>Aeromonas</i> species is given in Table 4 (6, 7, 13-15, 17, 23, 26).</s><s>Negative sucrose fermentation, positive mannitol fermentation, gas production from glucose, production of H<sub>2</sub>S from modified GCF media, and hemolysis on tryptic soy agar with 5% sheep blood could also be used as presumptive markers but showed slight variability within the group and were not as definitive as the profile markers described above.</s></p><p class="description"><s>API 20E profile numbers for these strains identified them all as "<i>A. hydrophila</i> complex," with an identification level of "good" to "excellent," but with the comment that the negative reaction for mannitol and/or sucrose was considered atypical in their data base.</s><s>Likewise, these strains were all identified as <i>A. hydrophila</i> in the Vitek system with a Gram Negative Identification (GNI) Card at 99% accuracy.</s></p><p class="description"><s>We have reported on the isolation and identification of a new <i>Aeromonas</i> species, designated <i>A. trota</i>.</s><s>This species has a biochemical profile of negative reactions for esculin hydrolysis, arabinose fermentation, Voges-Proskauer test, and gluconate oxidation, positive reactions for cellobiose fermentation, citrate utilization, and lysine decarboxylation, and a uniform dual susceptibility to ampicillin and carbenicillin.</s><s>Rapid identification systems, such as API 20E, and automated identification systems, such as the Vitek system, will identify these isolates as either <i>A. hydrophila</i> complex or <i>A. hydrophila</i>.</s><s>However, some of the distinguishing biochemical markers mentioned above are incorporated within these two systems and should lead the clinical microbiologist to suspect the possibility of <i>A. trota</i>.</s><s>Although <i>A. trota</i> appears to be predominantly from southern and southeastern Asia, it may in fact be present worldwide.</s><s>Documentation of its possible clinical significance and virulence potential for humans, presented here, strongly suggests that this species should be considered in biotyping of aeromonads from clinical and environmental sources.</s></p></content></protolog>
