{'content': 'Clostridium tanneri sp. nov., isolated from the faecal material of an alpaca.\n\nA strictly anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative rod-shaped bacterium, designated A1-XYC3T, was isolated from the faeces of an alpaca (Lama pacos). On the basis of the results of a comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the isolate was assigned to the genus Clostridium with the highest sequence similarities to Clostridium magnum DSM 2767T (96.8 %), Clostridium carboxidivorans P7T (96.3 %) and Clostridium aciditolerans JW/YJL-B3T (96.1 %). The average nucleotide identity between A1-XYC3T, C. magnum, C. carboxidivorans and C. aciditolerans was 77.4, 76.1 and 76.6 %, respectively. The predominant components of the cellular fatty acids of A1-XYC3T were C14 : 0, C16 : 0 and summed feature 10, containing C18:0/C17:0 cyclo. The DNA G+C content was 32.4 mol%. On the basis of biochemical, phylogenetic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic criteria, this isolate represents a novel species within Clostridium sensu stricto for which the name Clostridium tanneri sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of this species is strain A1-XYC3T (=CCM 9376T=NRRL B-65691T).\n\nPMID:38728064', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
