  {'content': 'Differential patterns of evolution and distribution of the symbiotic behaviour in nostocacean cyanobacteria.\n\nMany cyanobacteria commonly identified as belonging to the genus Nostoc are well-known cyanobionts (symbionts) of a wide variety of plants and fungi. They form symbioses with bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms that are considerably different in the type of reciprocal interaction between the host and the cyanobiont. The phylogenetic and taxonomic relationships among cyanobionts isolated from different hosts and Nostoc strains isolated from free-living conditions are still not well understood. We compared phylogeny and morphology of symbiotic cyanobacteria originating from different host plants (genera Gunnera, Azolla, Cycas, Dioon, Encephalartos, Macrozamia and Anthoceros) with free-living Nostoc isolates originating from different habitats. After preliminary clustering with ARDRA (amplified rDNA restriction analysis), phylogeny was reconstructed on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and compared with morphological characterization, obtaining several supported clusters. Two main Nostoc clusters harboured almost all cyanobionts of Gunnera, Anthoceros and of several cycads, together with free-living strains of the species Nostoc muscorum, Nostoc calcicola, Nostoc edaphicum, Nostoc ellipsosporum and strains related to Nostoc commune. We suggest that the frequent occurrence of symbiotic strains within these clusters is explained by the intensive hormogonia production that was observed in many of the strains studied. However, no evidence for discrimination between symbiotic and free-living strains, either by molecular or morphological approaches, could be found. Sequences of Azolla cyanobiont filaments, taken directly from leaf cavities, clustered tightly with sequences from the planktic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, from the benthic Anabaena cylindrica 133 and from Anabaena oscillarioides HINDAK 1984/43, with high bootstrap values. The phylogenetic analysis showed that two distinct patterns of evolution of symbiotic behaviour might exist for the nostocacean cyanobacteria, one leading to symbioses of Nostoc species with a wide variety of plants, the other leading to the association of a unique cyanobacterial type with the water fern Azolla.\n\nPMID:18319454', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

  {'content': 'Donghicola tyrosinivorans sp. nov., a tyrosine-degrading bacterium isolated from seawater.\n\nA Gram-stain-negative, non-motile, aerobic bacterium, strain 13-93-B1T, was isolated from seawater off Jeju Island, Republic of Korea, and was subjected to polyphasic taxonomic study. Cells formed ivory colonies and were ovoid to rod-shaped. The strain was catalase-positive, oxidase-negative and grew optimally at 30 °C, in the presence of 1-2 % (w/v) NaCl and at pH 7.0-7.5. It did not synthesize bacteriochlorophyll a. Neighbour-joining, maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain 13-93-B1T clustered with the type strain Donghicola eburneus SW-277T (97.0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). DNA-DNA hybridization between strain 13-93-B1T and D. eburneus KCTC 12735T was 33.1 ± 1.4 % (35.2 ± 2.8 % in a reciprocal experiment). The predominant cellular fatty acid was summed feature 8 (C18 : 1ω7c/C18 : 1ω6c; 76.9 %). The major respiratory quinone was ubiquinone Q-10 and polar lipids detected in strain 13-93-B1T were phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, an unidentified aminolipid and unidentified lipids. The DNA G+C content of strain 13-93-B1T was 60.4 mol%. Based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data presented, strain 13-93-B1T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Donghicola, for which the name Donghicola tyrosinivorans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 13-93-B1T ( = DSM 100212T = KCTC 42571T).\n\nPMID:26311168', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that strain DLS-44(T) belonged to the genus Dactylosporangium, with the type strains of Dactylosporangium roseum (99.1 % sequence similarity) and Dactylosporangium fulvum (99.0 %) as the nearest phylogenetic relatives.

DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed a reassociation value of less than 70% between representative strains of both subgroups, suggesting that two different species are represented. Although the extensive morphological and physiological analyses did not reveal any differentiating feature for the genotypes, differences in the presence of the cell-wall sugar mannose enabled the subgroups to be distinguished from one another.

  {'content': "Draconibacterium mangrovi sp. nov., isolated from mangrove sediment.\n\nA marine bacterial strain, designated GM2-18T, was isolated from mangrove sediment sampled at Luoyang River estuary, Quanzhou, PR China. Cells were Gram-stain-negative, slightly curved long rod-shaped and facultatively anaerobic with no flagellum. Catalase activity was found to be weak-positive and oxidase-positive. It had no ability to degrade or hydrolyse substrates including skimmed milk, cellulose, starch and Tweens (40, 60 and 80). The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain GM2-18T had maximum similarity values to 'Draconibacterium filum' F2T, Draconibacterium sediminis JN14CK-3T and Draconibacterium orientale FH5T of 98.0, 97.8 and 97.4 %, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain GM2-18T was affiliated to the genus Draconibacterium and formed a clade with an uncultured bacterium clone identified from mangrove environment. Average nucleotide identity values and DNA-DNA hybridization estimates of strain GM2-18T compared to its Draconibacterium relatives strongly supported that it belonged to a new species. The respiratory quinone was menaquinone MK-7. The major fatty acids (>10 %) consisted of iso-C15 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0 and C17 : 1 ω6c. The polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, a phospholipid and several unidentified lipids. The genomic size of strain GM2-18T was 5.9 Mb and the G+C content was 40.8 mol%. Gene prediction and annotation of strain GM2-18T indicated that there was a nitrogen-fixing gene cluster encoding nitrogenase molybdenum-iron protein and related proteins responsible for nitrogen fixation. Based on the above characteristics, strain GM2-18T represents a novel species within the genus Draconibacterium. Thus, Draconibacterium mangrovi sp. nov. is proposed with type strain GM2-18T (=MCCC 1K04382T=KCTC 72879T), isolated from mangrove sediment.\n\nPMID:32706333", 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain NS05T was shown to be phylogenetically related to the genera Ancylobacter, Starkeya and Angulomicrobium (96.3-98.1% sequence similarity), class Alphaproteobacteria. Strain NS05T was most closely related to Ancylobacter rudongensis AS 1.1761T (98.1% sequence similarity). The whole-cell fatty acid pattern of strain NS05T was typical of those found in members of the genus Ancylobacter. Its main components were C(18:1)omega7c (60.4%), C(19:0)omega8c cyclo (28.3%) and C(16:0) (7.4%) and hydroxylated compounds were absent. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization and physiological and biochemical tests allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain NS05T with respect to the four Ancylobacter species with validly published names. Therefore, it is concluded that NS05T represents a novel species of the genus Ancylobacter, for which the name Ancylobacter oerskovii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NS05T (=DSM 18746T=CCM 7435T). Two other oxalate-utilizing strains, NS03 and NS04, isolated from paper-mill effluents, were shown by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis to be affiliated to the species Ancylobacter polymorphus.

A polyphasic study was carried out to delineate the taxonomic identity of these two isolates (1P05MA(T) and KO_PS43). The 16S rRNA gene sequences exhibited a high similarity when compared to each other (100 %) and lower than 96.7 % relatedness with Arthrobacter crystallopoietes ATCC 15481(T), Arthrobacter luteolus ATCC BAA-272(T), Arthrobacter tumbae DSM 16406(T) and Arthrobacter subterraneus DSM 17585(T). In contrast with previously described Arthrobacter species, the novel isolates maintained their coccidal morphology throughout their growth and did not exhibit the rod-coccus life cycle typically observed in nearly all Arthrobacter species, except A. agilis. The distinct taxonomic identity of the novel isolates was confirmed based on their unique cell-wall peptidoglycan type (A.11.20; Lys-Ser-Ala2) and polar lipid profile (presence of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, an unknown phospholipid and two unknown glycolipids). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 70.6 mol%. The novel strains revealed MK-9(H2) and MK-8(H2) as dominant menaquinones and exhibited fatty acid profiles consisting of major amounts of anteiso-C15 : 0 and anteiso-C17 : 0 and moderate amounts of iso-C15 : 0 discriminating them again from closely related Arthrobacter species. Based on these observations, the authors propose that strains 1P05MA(T) and KO_PS43 be assigned into a separate genus Tersicoccus gen. nov.

Whole genome sequence analysis revealed the presence of an assimilatory cytoplasmic nitrate reductase gene nasA and the assimilatory nitrite reductase genes nirBD which are involved in the sequential reduction of nitrate to nitrite and further to ammonium, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolate represents a member of the genus Pseudomonas.

In order to determine its taxonomic position, the novel strain was characterized using a polyphasic approach. The new strain was Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, non-spore-forming, motile and short rod-shaped. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain Ch07(T) belonged to the class Betaproteobacteria, being related to Pusillimonas noertemannii BN9(T) (gene sequence similarity 97.30 %), Achromobacter xylosoxidans subsp. xylosoxidans DSM 10346(T) (97.09 %), Bordetella pertussis DSM 5571(T) (97.01 %), Pigmentiphaga kullae DSM 13608(T) (96.68 %) and Castellaniella defragrans DSM 1214(T) (96.47 %). The results of DNA-DNA hybridization tests showed that reassociation values were less than 62 % with respect to these closely related type strains. Chemotaxonomic data showed that strain Ch07(T) possessed ubiquinone Q-8. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 67.9+/-0.1 mol%. The major polyamine of strain Ch07(T) was putrescine. The major polar lipids of strain Ch07(T) were phosphatidylethanolamine, followed by diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol.

The bacterium was strictly aerobic, chemoheterotrophic, catalase- and oxidase-positive, consisted of non-motile rods and grew optimally at 30 °C, pH 7 and 1 % NaCl. The predominant cellular fatty acids were C18 : 1ω7c and cyclo-C19 : 0ω8c. The major isoprenoid quinone was Q-10. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, a phosphoglycolipid and an aminolipid. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolate was closely related to members of the genus Maribius. The highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity was found to be 97.5 % to Maribius salinus followed by 97.4 % to Maribius pelagius; levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between the novel strain and other representatives of family Rhodobacteraceae were <95.5 %.

  {'content': 'Lactobacillus rossii sp. nov., isolated from wheat sourdough.\n\nScreening of sourdough lactic acid bacteria for bacteriocin production resulted in the isolation of a Gram-positive, catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile rod bacterium (strain CS1T) that could not be associated with any previously described species. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis recognized strain CS1T as a distinct member of the genus Lactobacillus. By a species-specific PCR strategy, five additional strains previously isolated from sourdoughs were found to belong to the same species as strain CS1T, as confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The closest related species were Lactobacillus durianis, Lactobacillus malefermentans and Lactobacillus suebicus, with which strain CS1T shared 93 % sequence similarity. For a further characterization of strain CS1T, physiological (growth temperature, CO2 production, hydrolysis of arginine, isomeric type of lactate, sugar fermentation) and chemotaxonomic (G+C content and peptidoglycan structure) properties were determined. Phenotypic characterization showed that strain CS1T was a member of the obligately heterofermentative group of the genus Lactobacillus. The DNA G+C content was 44.6 mol%. The peptidoglycan was of the A3alpha (L-Lys-L-Ser-L-Ala2) type. Physiological, biochemical and genotypic data, as well as results of DNA-DNA hybridization of genomic DNA with one of the closest phylogenetic relatives, L. durianis (34.3 %), indicated that strain CS1T represents a novel species of the genus Lactobacillus for which the name Lactobacillus rossii sp. nov. is proposed.

  {'content': 'Pseudomonas kirkiae sp. nov., a novel species isolated from oak in the United Kingdom, and phylogenetic considerations of the genera Pseudomonas, Azotobacter and Azomonas.\n\nAs the current episode of Acute Oak Decline (AOD) continues to affect native British oak in the United Kingdom, ongoing isolations from symptomatic and healthy oak have yielded a large Pseudomonas species population. These strains could be divided into taxa representing three potential novel species. Recently, two of these taxa were described as novel Pseudomonas species in the Pseudomonas fluorescens lineage. Here, we demonstrate using a polyphasic approach that the third taxon represents another novel Pseudomonas species. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing assigned the strains to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lineage, while multilocus sequence analysis (based on partial gyrB, rpoB and rpoD sequences) placed the 13 strains in a single cluster on the border of the Pseudomonas stutzeri group. Whole genome intra-species comparisons (based on average nucleotide identity and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization) confirmed that the strains belong to a single taxon, while the inter-species comparisons with closest phylogenetic relatives yielded similarity values below the accepted species threshold. Therefore, we propose these strains as a novel species, namely Pseudomonas kirkiae sp. nov., with the type strain FRB 229T (P4CT=LMG 31089T=NCPPB 4674T). The phylogenetic analyses performed in this study highlighted the difficulties in assigning novel species to the genus Pseudomonas due to its polyphyletic nature and close relationship to the genus Azotobacter.

These isolates were characterized by a polyphasic approach and represent a new lineage of gamma-Proteobacteria as their closest relative is Xylella fastidiosa (87.1% 16S rDNA similarity). The four strains are identical at the 16S rDNA level, the level of similarity between them, based on DNA-DNA hybridization, is high (97.8-102.5%) and they are similar in their physiological and biochemical characteristics, although they differ in their utilization of different sole carbon sources. All produce chitinase. They are obligately aerobic: no growth is detected under anaerobic conditions, even in the presence of NO3- as terminal electron acceptor. Their predominant respiratory quinone is Q-8. The G+C content of their DNA is 42 mol%. Their cell membrane contains phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and two unknown polar lipids. Their main fatty acids are C18:1, C16:0 and C14:0. To accommodate these bacteria, a new genus, Schineria gen. nov., with the type species Schineria larvae sp. nov., is proposed.\n\nPMID:11321085', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

Complete 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the organism was most closely related to Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma imitans(99.7 and 99.9 % similarity, respectively). The average DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain 56A97T and M. gallisepticum and M. imitans were 39.5 and 30 %, respectively and the Genome to Genome Distance Calculator gave results of 29.10 and 23.50 %, respectively. The 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer was 72-73 % similar to M. gallisepticum strains and 52.2 % to M. imitans. A partial sequence of rpoB was 91.1-92 % similar to M. gallisepticum strains and 84.7 % to M. imitans. Colonies possessed a typical fried-egg appearance and electron micrographs revealed the lack of a cell wall and a nearly spherical morphology, with an electron-dense tip-like structure on some flask-shaped cells. The isolate required sterol for growth, fermented glucose, adsorbed and haemolysed erythrocytes, but did not hydrolyse arginine or urea. The strain was compared serologically against 110 previously described Mycoplasma reference strains, showing that, except for M. gallisepticum, strain 56A97T is not related to any of the previously described species, although weak cross-reactions were evident.

The isolates exhibit chemotaxonomic and morphological properties consistent with their classification in the family Streptomycetaceae. They form extensively branched substrate mycelia bearing aerial hyphae that differentiate into straight chains of cylindrical spores. The whole-organism hydrolysates contain ll-diaminopimelic acid, glucose, mannose and ribose, the predominant isoprenologue is MK-9(H8), the polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol and glycophospholipids, and the major fatty acids are anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 0, iso-C16 : 0 and anteiso-C17 : 0. Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and multilocus gene sequences of conserved housekeeping genes show that the isolates form a well-supported lineage that is most closely related to Streptomyces parmotrematis NBRC 115203T.

Draft genomes assemblies of the isolates are rich in biosynthetic gene clusters predicted to produce novel specialized metabolites and stress-related genes which provide an insight into how they have adapted to the harsh conditions that prevail in pine litter. Phylogenomically, both isolates belong to the same lineage as the type strains of S. cattleyicolor, S. ferralitis, S. parmotrematis and S. rubrisoli; these relationships are underpinned by high average amino acid identity, average nucleotide identity and genomic DNA-DNA hybridization values. These metrics confirm that isolates SL13 and SL54T belong to a novel species that is most closely related to S. parmotrematis NBRC 115203T and that these strains together with S. ferralitis DSM 41836T, S. rubrisoli DSM 42083T belong to the genus Streptantibioticus.

Cells of strain V2M29(T) were Gram-positive, rod-shaped (0.5-0.8 μm in diameter and 1.5-2.0 μm in length), strictly aerobic and non-motile. Colonies produced on R2A agar plates were creamy, smooth, circular and 0.3-0.8 mm in diameter. Strain V2M29(T) grew at 14-35 °C (optimum, 29 °C), at pH 4.1-10.0 (optimum, pH 7.0-8.0) and in the presence of 0-7.0 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0-2.0 %). Strain V2M29(T) contained MK-8(H(4)) as the major respiratory quinone and iso-C(15 : 0) (20.9 %), iso-C(16 : 0) (18.5 %), C(17 : 1)ω8c (16.7 %) and 10-methyl-C(17 : 0) (9.2 %) as the major cellular fatty acids.

Diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and six unknown glycolipids were the major polar lipids. The G+C content of the DNA was 72.0 mol% (T(m)). 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain V2M29(T) was phylogenetically related to members of the genus Phycicoccus, with sequence similarities ranging from 96.6-97.8 %.

  {'content': 'Lewinella aurantiaca sp. nov., a carotenoid pigment-producing bacterium isolated from surface seawater.\n\nA Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped, carotenoid-pigmented, motile-by-gliding bacterium, which was designated as SSH13T, was isolated from a surface seawater sample collected from Sehwa Beach in the Republic of Korea. Strain SSH13T was oxidase-negative, catalase-positive and grew at 2-37 °C (optimum, 30 °C), in the presence of 0.5-6% NaCl and within a pH range of pH 6-10 (optimum, pH 8). The novel isolate required NaCl for growth and grew optimally with approximately 2 % NaCl. Chemotaxonomic and morphological characteristics were consistent with members of the genus Lewinella. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that strain SSH13T was most closely related to the type strains of the genus Lewinella. Strain SSH13T had highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities to Lewinella persica DSM 23188T (95.3 %) and Lewinella agarilytica KCTC 12774T (95.0 %). The major fatty acids of SSH13T were summed feature 3 (C16 : 1 ω7c and/or C16 : 1 ω6c) and iso-C15 : 0. Strain SSH13T contained phosphatidylethanolamine as a major polar lipid.

A group of 81 S. sciuri isolates obtained from human (n=62) and veterinary (n=17) clinical materials and foods (n=2) and ten reference and type strains obtained from the Czech Collection of Microorganisms were characterized by extensive biotyping using conventional tests and commercial identification kits (ID 32 Staph, STAPHYtest, Biolog Microbial ID System), matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, automated ribotyping with EcoRI restriction enzyme, 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic transcribed spacer PCR fingerprinting and repetitive sequence-based PCR fingerprinting with the (GTG)5 primer. Selected strains representing different ribotypes were further characterized using sequencing of the β-subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB) gene.

  {'content': 'Rothia endophytica sp. nov., an actinobacterium isolated from Dysophylla stellata (Lour.) Benth.\n\nA novel endophytic actinobacterium, designated strain YIM 67072(T), was isolated from healthy roots of Dysophylla stellata (Lour.) Benth. Cells of this aerobic, cream-yellow-coloured strain occurred singly, in pairs or in tetrads, were Gram-stain-positive and ovoid- to spherical-shaped. Strain YIM 67072(T) grew at 4-45 °C, pH 5.0-10.0 and in the presence of 0-7 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain YIM 67072(T) belonged to the genus Rothia. The isolate contained MK-7 as the major component of the quinone system. The peptidoglycan type was A3α. The polar lipid profile consisted predominantly of diphosphatidylglycerol and glycolipids. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 0, anteiso-C17 : 0 and iso-C16 : 0. The DNA G+C content was 53.2 mol%. However, strain YIM 67072(T) differed from its closest relatives Rothia nasimurium CCUG 35957(T) (98.5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Rothia amarae JCM 11375(T) (97.6 %) and Rothia terrae L-143(T) (97.3 %) in many phenotypic characteristics. Moreover, the levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between the novel isolate and the three above-mentioned type strains were 28.7±1.3 %, 36.5±1.2 %, 46.8±1.5 %, respectively. Based on comparative analysis of physiological and chemotaxonomic data, strain YIM 67072(T) represents a novel species of the genus Rothia, for which the name Rothia endophytica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 67072(T) ( = DSM 26247(T) = JCM 18541(T)).\n\nPMID:23710050', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

  {'content': 'Rothia endophytica sp. nov., an actinobacterium isolated from Dysophylla stellata (Lour.) Benth.\n\nA novel endophytic actinobacterium, designated strain YIM 67072(T), was isolated from healthy roots of Dysophylla stellata (Lour.) Benth. Cells of this aerobic, cream-yellow-coloured strain occurred singly, in pairs or in tetrads, were Gram-stain-positive and ovoid- to spherical-shaped. Strain YIM 67072(T) grew at 4-45 °C, pH 5.0-10.0 and in the presence of 0-7 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain YIM 67072(T) belonged to the genus Rothia. The isolate contained MK-7 as the major component of the quinone system. The peptidoglycan type was A3α. The polar lipid profile consisted predominantly of diphosphatidylglycerol and glycolipids. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 0, anteiso-C17 : 0 and iso-C16 : 0. The DNA G+C content was 53.2 mol%. However, strain YIM 67072(T) differed from its closest relatives Rothia nasimurium CCUG 35957(T) (98.5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Rothia amarae JCM 11375(T) (97.6 %) and Rothia terrae L-143(T) (97.3 %) in many phenotypic characteristics. Moreover, the levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between the novel isolate and the three above-mentioned type strains were 28.7±1.3 %, 36.5±1.2 %, 46.8±1.5 %, respectively. Based on comparative analysis of physiological and chemotaxonomic data, strain YIM 67072(T) represents a novel species of the genus Rothia, for which the name Rothia endophytica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 67072(T) ( = DSM 26247(T) = JCM 18541(T)).\n\nPMID:23710050', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

As no phytoplasma has been cultured in cell-free medium, phytoplasmas cannot be differentiated and classified by the traditional methods which are applied to culturable prokaryotes. Over the past decade, the establishment of a phytoplasma classification scheme based on 16S rRNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns has enabled the accurate and reliable identification and classification of a wide range of phytoplasmas. In the present study, we expanded this classification scheme through the use of computer-simulated RFLP analysis, achieving rapid differentiation and classification of phytoplasmas. Over 800 publicly available phytoplasma 16S rRNA gene sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL_X program and the aligned 1.25 kb fragments were exported to pDRAW32 software for in silico restriction digestion and virtual gel plotting. Based on distinctive virtual RFLP patterns and calculated similarity coefficients, phytoplasma strains were classified into 28 groups.

The two strains had identical 16S rRNA gene sequences and were most closely related to Pinisolibacter ravus E9T (97.36 %) and Siculibacillus lacustris SA-279T (96.33 %). Cells were facultatively aerobic rods and motile with a single polar flagellum. The strains were able to degrade ethylbenzene as sole source of carbon and energy. The assembled genome of strain B13T had a total length of 4.91 Mb and the DNA G+C content was 68.8 mol%. The predominant fatty acids (>5 % of the total) of strains B13T and MA2-2 were C18 : 1 ω7c/C18 : 1 ω6c, C16 : 1 ω7c/C16 : 1 ω6c and C16 : 0.

  {'content': 'Indibacter alkaliphilus gen. nov., sp. nov., an alkaliphilic bacterium isolated from a haloalkaline lake.\n\nA novel Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, non-motile bacterium, strain LW1(T), was isolated from a water sample collected at a depth of 3.5 m from Lonar Lake, Buldhana district, Maharashtra, India. The cell suspension was reddish-orange due to the presence of carotenoids. Strain LW1(T) was positive for catalase, oxidase, ornithine decarboxylase and lysine decarboxylase and negative for gelatinase, urease and lipase. Fatty acids were dominated by branched-chain fatty acids (>76 %), with a high abundance of iso-C(15 : 0) (48 %), anteiso-C(15 : 0) (7 %) and iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH (11 %). Strain LW1(T) contained MK-4 and MK-7 as the major respiratory quinones and phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine as the major phospholipids. A blast sequence similarity search based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that members of the genera Belliella and Aquiflexum were the nearest phylogenetic neighbours with similarities of 91.8-92.3 %.

The cell suspension was reddish-orange due to the presence of carotenoids. Strain LW1(T) was positive for catalase, oxidase, ornithine decarboxylase and lysine decarboxylase and negative for gelatinase, urease and lipase. Fatty acids were dominated by branched-chain fatty acids (>76 %), with a high abundance of iso-C(15 : 0) (48 %), anteiso-C(15 : 0) (7 %) and iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH (11 %). Strain LW1(T) contained MK-4 and MK-7 as the major respiratory quinones and phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine as the major phospholipids. A blast sequence similarity search based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that members of the genera Belliella and Aquiflexum were the nearest phylogenetic neighbours with similarities of 91.8-92.3 %.

  {'content': 'Pontivivens ytuae sp. nov., isolated from deep sea sediment of the Mariana Trench.\n\nA Gram-stain-negative, light pink-coloured, rod-shaped, flagellated and facultative anaerobic bacterial strain, designated MT2928T, was isolated from deep-sea sediment collected from the Mariana Trench. Growth of strain MT2928T occurred optimally at 28 °C, pH 8.0-9.0 and in the presence of 1.0-2.0 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain MT2928T belongs to the genus Pontivivens and has the highest sequence similarity to Pontivivens insulae GYSW-23T (96.6 %). Genomic analysis indicated that strain MT2928T contains a circular chromosome of 4 199 362 bp with G+C content of 67.2 mol%. The strain did not produce bacteriochlorophyll a, but produced carotenoid. The predominant respiratory quinone of MT2928T was ubiquinone-10. The polar lipids of MT2928T contained diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified lipids and two unidentified phospholipids. The major fatty acids of strain MT2928T contained summed feature 8 (C18 : 1 ω7c or/and C18 : 1 ω6c), C18 : 0 and summed feature 2 (iso-C16 : 1 I and/or C14 : 0 3-OH). On the basis of phylogenetic, physiological, biochemical and other phenotypic properties, strain MT2928T represents a novel species of the genus Pontivivens, and the name Pontivivens ytuae sp. nov. is proposed with the type species MT2928T (=MCCC 1K05575T=JCM 34320T).\n\nPMID:34520339', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

  {'content': 'Amycolatopsis rhizosphaerae sp. nov., isolated from rice rhizosphere soil.\n\nA novel actinomycete, designated strain DH51B-4-3T, which formed long chains of spherical spores borne on the tip of sporophores arising from the aerial mycelium, was isolated from rice rhizosphere soil. The isolate contained meso-diaminopimelic acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. The whole-cell sugars of strain DH51B-4-3T were arabinose, galactose, glucose, rhamnose and ribose. The phospholipids in the cell membrane were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidyl methylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol. The major menaquinone was MK-9(H4). The main cellular fatty acids were iso-C16 : 0 and cyclo-C17 : 0. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 68.2 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain DH51B-4-3T should be classified in the genus Amycolatopsis and closely related to Amycolatopsis dongchuanensis YIM 75904T (98.06 %) and Amycolatopsis sacchari DSM 44468T (97.77 %). The result of DNA-DNA hybridization and some physiological and biochemical properties indicated that strain DH51B-4-3T could be readily distinguished from its closest phylogenetic relatives. On the basis of these phenotypic and genotypic data, this strain represents a novel species, for which the name Amycolatopsis rhizosphaerae sp. nov. is proposed.

  {'content': 'Formosa sediminum sp. nov., a starch-degrading bacterium isolated from marine sediment.\n\nA novel bacterium, designated strain PS13T, was isolated from marine sediment collected from the coast of Jeju Island. Strain PS13T was a Gram stain-negative, catalase- and oxidase-positive, aerobic, yellow-pigmented, motile by gliding, and rod-shaped bacterium. Strain PS13T grew optimally at 25 °C and pH 8.0 and in the presence of 3 % (w/v) NaCl. Results of phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain PS13T belonged to the genus Formosa and was closely related to Formosa algae KMM3553T (98.3 % sequence similarity). The DNA-DNA relatedness (17.3-21.8 %) and average nucleotide identity (83.6-84.6 %) values clearly indicated that strain PS13T represents a distinct species of the genus Formosa. The major fatty acids were C15 : 0 iso, C16 : 1 ω6c/C16 : 1 ω7c and C15 : 1 iso G. The genomic DNA G+C content of the strain PS13T was 32.2 mol%. On the basis of polyphasic characteristics, it is suggested that strain PS13T be assigned to the genus Formosa as the type strain of a novel species, for which the name Formosa sediminum PS13T (=KCCM 43301T=CECT 9918T) sp. nov. is proposed.\n\nPMID:32228775', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

Morphological characteristics of this strain included long chains of rod-like cells and squarish elements. The cell-wall composition of this novel isolate contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. The whole-cell diagnostic sugars were arabinose and galactose. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H4). The major fatty acids were iso-C16 : 0 and iso-C15 : 0. Only phosphatidylethanolamine was detected as a polar lipid. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain GLM-1T was closely related to Amycolatopsis rhabdoformis SB026T (99.11 %) with a low DNA-DNA hybridization value of 22.6-34.7 %. Genome sequencing revealed a genome size of 10 Mbp. There were obvious distinctions in the average nucleotide identity values between stain GLM-1T and its closely related strains at around 86-93 % (ANIb) and 89-94 % (ANIm). The digital DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain GLM-1T and type strains of phylogenetically related species were 34-55 %. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 71.8 mol%.

  {'content': "Molecular genotyping of human Ureaplasma species based on multiple-banded antigen (MBA) gene sequences.\n\nUreaplasma urealyticum has been divided into 14 serovars. Recently, subdivision of U. urealyticum into two species has been proposed: U. parvum (previously U. urealyticum parvo biovar), comprising four serovars (1, 3, 6, 14) and U. urealyticum (previously U. urealyticum T-960 biovar), 10 serovars (2, 4, 5, 7-13). The multiple-banded antigen (MBA) genes of these species contain both species and serovar/subtype specific sequences. Based on whole sequences of the 5'-ends of MBA genes of U. parvum serovars and partial sequences of the 5'-ends of MBA genes of U. urealyticum serovars, we previously divided each of these species into three MBA genotypes. To further elucidate the relationships between serovars, we sequenced the whole 5'-ends of MBA genes of all 10 U. urealyticum serovars and partial repetitive regions of these genes from all serovars of U. parvum and U. urealyticum. For the first time, all four serovars of U. parvum were clearly differentiated from each other. In addition, the 10 serovars of U. urealyticum were divided into five MBA genotypes, as follows: MBA genotype A comprises serovars 2, 5, 8; MBA genotype B, serovar 10 only; MBA genotype C, serovars 4, 12, 13; MBA genotype D, serovar 9 only; and MBA genotype E comprises serovars 7 and 11. There were no sequence differences between members within each MBA genotype. Further work is required to identify other genes or other regions of the MBA genes that may be used to differentiate U. urealyticum serovars within MBA genotypes A, C and E. A better understanding of the molecular basis of serotype differentiation will help to improve subtyping methods for use in studies of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of these organisms.\n\nPMID:11034506", 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

The results of phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that these two strains were closely related to Caldovatus sediminis YIM 72346T (96.75 and 96.89 % sequence similarity, respectively). The whole genome size of strain SYSU G05006T was 3.87 Mbp with a DNA G+C content of 75.33 mol%. The average nucleotide identity (ANI based on the MUMmer algorithm≤90.31 % and ANI based on blast≤89.36 %) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (≤35.10 %) values between strain SYSU G05006T and other members of the family Acetobacteraceae were all lower than the threshold values recommended for distinguishing novel prokaryotic species. Optimal growth of the strain was observed at 55 °C and pH 6.0. Ubiquinone-10 was the predominant respiratory lipoquinone.

  Text:
  {'content': 'Caldovatus aquaticus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic bacterium isolated from hot spring microbial mat.\n\nTwo closely related, aerobic, Gram-stain-negative, motile, oval-shaped, non-endospore-forming, moderately thermophilic bacteria, designated strains SYSU G05006T and SYSU G05005, were isolated from a bioreactor enrichment and the original sample was collected from Rehai National Park, Tengchong, Yunnan Province, PR China. The results of phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that these two strains were closely related to Caldovatus sediminis YIM 72346T (96.75 and 96.89 % sequence similarity, respectively). The whole genome size of strain SYSU G05006T was 3.87 Mbp with a DNA G+C content of 75.33 mol%. The average nucleotide identity (ANI based on the MUMmer algorithm≤90.31 % and ANI based on blast≤89.36 %) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (≤35.10 %) values between strain SYSU G05006T and other members of the family Acetobacteraceae were all lower than the threshold values recommended for distinguishing novel prokaryotic species. Optimal growth of the strain was observed at 55 °C and pH 6.0. Ubiquinone-10 was the predominant respiratory lipoquinone. The major cellular fatty acids included iso-C14 : 0, C16 : 1 ω5c, summed feature 5 and summed feature 7. The major polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified aminolipid, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, two unidentified phospholipids and two unidentified lipids. Based on results of phylogenetic analyses, comparative genomics and phenotypic characteristics, we describe a new species of the genus Caldovatus represented by strain SYSU G05006T (=KCTC 82831T=MCCC 1K06125T), for which we propose the name Caldovatus aquaticus sp. nov.\n\nPMID:36748592', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

Strain DY56-A-20T was found to grow at 15-37 °C (optimum, 28 °C), at pH 6.0-10.0 (optimum, pH 6.5-7.0) and in 0.5-6.0 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 1.0-2.0 %), while strain G39T was found to grow at 10-42 °C (optimum, 35-40 °C), at pH 5.5-10.0 (optimum, pH 6.5-7.0) and in 0-12.0 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 1.0-2.0 %). The 16S rRNA gene sequence identity analysis indicated that strain DY56-A-20T had the highest sequence identity with Qipengyuania marisflavi KEM-5T (97.6 %), while strain G39T displayed the highest sequence identity with Qipengyuania citrea H150T (98.8 %). The phylogenomic reconstruction indicated that both strains formed independent clades within the genus Qipengyuania. The digital DNA-DNA hybridization and average nucleotide identity values between strains DY56-A-20T/G39T and Qipengyuania/Erythrobacter type strains were 17.8-23.8 % and 70.7-81.1 %, respectively, which are below species delineation thresholds. The genome DNA G+C contents were 65.0 and 63.5 mol% for strains DY56-A-20T and G39T, respectively. The predominant cellular fatty acids (>10 %) of strain DY56-A-20T were C17 : 1 ω6c, summed feature 8 and summed feature 3, and the major cellular fatty acids of strain G39T were C17 : 1 ω6c and summed feature 8. The major polar lipids in both strains were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, sphingoglycolipid and an unidentified polar lipid. The only respiratory quinone present in both strains was ubiquinone-10. Based on those genotypic and phenotypic results, the two strains represent two novel species belonging to the genus Qipengyuania, for which the names Qipengyuania benthica sp. nov. and Qipengyuania profundimaris sp. nov. are proposed. The type strain of Q. benthica is DY56-A-20T (=MCCC M27941T=KCTC 92309T), and the type strain of Q. profundimaris is G39T (=MCCC M30353T=KCTC 8208T).\n\nPMID:38546450', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

  {'content': 'Qipengyuania benthica sp. nov. and Qipengyuania profundimaris sp. nov., two novel Erythrobacteraceae members isolated from deep-sea environments.\n\nTwo Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped and non-motile strains, designated as DY56-A-20T and G39T, were isolated from deep-sea sediment of the Pacific Ocean and deep-sea seawater of the Indian Ocean, respectively. Strain DY56-A-20T was found to grow at 15-37 °C (optimum, 28 °C), at pH 6.0-10.0 (optimum, pH 6.5-7.0) and in 0.5-6.0 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 1.0-2.0 %), while strain G39T was found to grow at 10-42 °C (optimum, 35-40 °C), at pH 5.5-10.0 (optimum, pH 6.5-7.0) and in 0-12.0 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 1.0-2.0 %). The 16S rRNA gene sequence identity analysis indicated that strain DY56-A-20T had the highest sequence identity with Qipengyuania marisflavi KEM-5T (97.6 %), while strain G39T displayed the highest sequence identity with Qipengyuania citrea H150T (98.8 %). The phylogenomic reconstruction indicated that both strains formed independent clades within the genus Qipengyuania. The digital DNA-DNA hybridization and average nucleotide identity values between strains DY56-A-20T/G39T and Qipengyuania/Erythrobacter type strains were 17.8-23.8 % and 70.7-81.1 %, respectively, which are below species delineation thresholds. The genome DNA G+C contents were 65.0 and 63.5 mol% for strains DY56-A-20T and G39T, respectively. The predominant cellular fatty acids (>10 %) of strain DY56-A-20T were C17 : 1 ω6c, summed feature 8 and summed feature 3, and the major cellular fatty acids of strain G39T were C17 : 1 ω6c and summed feature 8. The major polar lipids in both strains were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, sphingoglycolipid and an unidentified polar lipid. The only respiratory quinone present in both strains was ubiquinone-10. Based on those genotypic and phenotypic results, the two strains represent two novel species belonging to the genus Qipengyuania, for which the names Qipengyuania benthica sp. nov. and Qipengyuania profundimaris sp. nov. are proposed. The type strain of Q. benthica is DY56-A-20T (=MCCC M27941T=KCTC 92309T), and the type strain of Q. profundimaris is G39T (=MCCC M30353T=KCTC 8208T).\n\nPMID:38546450', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

  {'content': 'Amycolatopsis minnesotensis sp. nov., isolated from a prairie soil.\n\nTwo actinomycete strains, 32U-2T and 32U-4, were isolated from a prairie soil in Minnesota and subjected to characterization by means of polyphasic taxonomy. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were determined following PCR amplification and cloning. A phylogenetic analysis, based on comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, indicated that the organisms consistently formed a well-separated, distinct sub-branch within the radiation of the genus Amycolatopsis of the family Pseudonocardiaceae. The levels of 16S rRNA sequence similarity between the isolates and the type strains of recognized Amycolatopsis species ranged from 94.1 to 97.9 %. The highest levels of sequence similarity were found between the isolates and Amycolatopsis coloradensis (97.6-97.9 %), Amycolatopsis alba and Amycolatopsis orientalis (97.3-97.6 %) and Amycolatopsis lurida (97.2-97.5 %). Chemotaxonomic characteristics supported the phylogenetic relationships between the organisms and members of the genus Amycolatopsis. However, a broad range of phenotypic and genetic data revealed that the isolates should be classified as novel species of the genus Amycolatopsis, for which the name Amycolatopsis minnesotensis sp. nov. is proposed.

  {'content': 'Amycolatopsis minnesotensis sp. nov., isolated from a prairie soil.\n\nTwo actinomycete strains, 32U-2T and 32U-4, were isolated from a prairie soil in Minnesota and subjected to characterization by means of polyphasic taxonomy. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were determined following PCR amplification and cloning. A phylogenetic analysis, based on comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, indicated that the organisms consistently formed a well-separated, distinct sub-branch within the radiation of the genus Amycolatopsis of the family Pseudonocardiaceae. The levels of 16S rRNA sequence similarity between the isolates and the type strains of recognized Amycolatopsis species ranged from 94.1 to 97.9 %. The highest levels of sequence similarity were found between the isolates and Amycolatopsis coloradensis (97.6-97.9 %), Amycolatopsis alba and Amycolatopsis orientalis (97.3-97.6 %) and Amycolatopsis lurida (97.2-97.5 %). Chemotaxonomic characteristics supported the phylogenetic relationships between the organisms and members of the genus Amycolatopsis. However, a broad range of phenotypic and genetic data revealed that the isolates should be classified as novel species of the genus Amycolatopsis, for which the name Amycolatopsis minnesotensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 32U-2T (=KCCM 42246T = NRRL B-24435T).\n\nPMID:16403896', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

Cells of the isolate were Gram-negative, aerobic, straight rods, motile by a single polar flagellum. The strain grew at 4-42 °C, with optimum growth at 35 °C at pH 7, and at pH 6-10. It hydrolysed Tweens 20, 40, 60 and 80, but not casein, gelatin, starch or DNA. Its major isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone-9 (Q-9) and the DNA G+C content was 65.1 mol%. The whole-cell fatty acid profile consisted mainly of C(16 : 0), C(16 : 1)ω9c and C(18 : 1)ω9c. Phylogenetic analyses based on gyrB, rpoB and rpoD sequences revealed that the isolate could be discriminated from Pseudomonas species that exhibited more than 97 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and phylogenetic neighbours belonging to the P. oleovorans group including the closest relative of the isolate, Pseudomonas alcaliphila. DNA-DNA hybridization with P. alcaliphila AL15-21(T) revealed 51 ± 5 % relatedness. Owing to differences in phenotypic properties and phylogenetic analyses based on multilocus gene sequence analysis and DNA-DNA relatedness data, the isolate merits classification in a novel species, for which the name Pseudomonas toyotomiensis sp. nov. is proposed.

  {'content': 'Alcanivorax balearicus sp. nov., isolated from Lake Martel.\n\nA bacterial strain designated MACL04(T) was isolated from Lake Martel, a subterraneous saline lake in Mallorca (Spain). The complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of this strain showed nearly 100 % similarity to that of Alcanivorax dieselolei B-5(T). Despite this high similarity, strain MACL04(T) showed phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular differences with respect to A. dieselolei, indicating that strain MACL04(T) represents a separate species. Cells of strain MACL04(T) were motile by means of a single polar or subpolar flagellum and colonies formed on media containing 1 % (v/v) Tween 20 were opaque and mucoid, with blue-green iridescence. The generation time of strain MACL04(T) in this medium was approximately half that of A. dieselolei B-5(T) and strain MACL04(T) did not produce lipases after incubation for 5 days. Strain MACL04(T) did not require NaCl for growth and grew in the presence of up to 15 % (w/v) NaCl. The strain was able to use alkanes as a sole carbon source; however, glucose could also be used, albeit weakly, as a carbon source. Several amino acids and organic acids were used as carbon sources. Strain MACL04(T) produced acid in media containing pyruvate as the sole carbon source. The major fatty acids were C(19 : 0) cyclo omega8c and C(16 : 0). The fatty acid C(16 : 1)omega8c, present in strain MACL04(T), was not detected in the recognized Alcanivorax species. The sequences of the large and short 16S-23S intergenic spacer regions showed similarities of 97.2 and 98.8 % (ungapped) with respect to A. dieselolei B-5(T). Partial sequences of gyrB and alkb genes showed 94.0 % similarity between strain MACL04(T) and A. dieselolei B-5(T). The G+C content of strain MACL04(T) was 62.8 mol%. The data from this polyphasic study indicate that strain MACL04(T) represents a novel species of the genus Alcanivorax, for which the name Alcanivorax balearicus sp. nov. is proposed.

  {'content': 'Whole-genome-based revisit of Photorhabdus phylogeny: proposal for the elevation of most Photorhabdus subspecies to the species level and description of one novel species Photorhabdus bodei sp. nov., and one novel subspecies Photorhabdus laumondii subsp. clarkei subsp. nov.\n\nBacterial symbionts are crucial for the infectivity and success of entomopathogenic nematodes as biological control agents. The current understanding of the symbiotic relationships is limited by taxonomic uncertainties. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing and traditional techniques to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships between all described Photorhabdus species and subspecies as well as 11 newly isolated symbiotic bacteria of Heterorhabditis nematodes, including the unreported bacterial partner of H. beicherriana. In silico DNA-DNA hybridization, orthologous average nucleotide identity and nucleotide sequence identity of concatenated housekeeping genes scores were calculated and set into relation with current cut-off values for species delimitation in bacteria. Sequence data were complemented with biochemical and chemotaxonomic markers, and ribosomal protein fingerprinting profiles. This polyphasic approach resolves the ambiguous taxonomy of Photorhabdusand lead to the proposal for the elevation of most of them into a higher taxon and the creation of several new taxa: 15 new species, one of which is newly described: Photorhabdus bodei sp. nov. (type strain LJ24-63T=DSM 105690T=CCOS 1159T) and the other 14 arise through the proposal of elevating already described subspecies to species, and are proposed to be renamed as follows: Photorhabdus asymbioticasubsp. australis as Photorhabdus australis sp. nov., Photorhabdus luminescenssubsp. akhurstii as Photorhabdus akhurstii sp. nov., Photorhabdus luminescenssubsp. caribbeanensis as Photorhabdus caribbeanensis sp. nov., Photorhabdus luminescenssubsp. hainanensis as Photorhabdus hainanensis sp. nov., Photorhabdus luminescenssubsp. kayaii as Photorhabdus kayaii sp. nov., Photorhabdus luminescenssubsp. kleinii as Photorhabdus kleinii sp. nov., Photorhabdus luminescenssubsp. namnaonensis as Photorhabdus namnaonensis sp. nov., Photorhabdus luminescenssubsp. noenieputensis as Photorhabdus noenieputensis sp. nov., Photorhabdus luminescenssubsp.laumondii as Photorhabdus laumondii sp. nov., Photorhabdus temperatasubsp. cinerea as Photorhabdus cinerea sp. nov., Photorhabdus temperatasubsp. khanii as Photorhabdus khanii sp. nov., Photorhabdus temperatasubsp. stackebrandtii as Photorhabdus stackebrandtii sp. nov., Photorhabdus temperatasubsp. tasmaniensis as Photorhabdus tasmaniensis sp. nov., and Photorhabdus temperatasubsp. thracensis as Photorhabdus thracensis sp. nov.

Here, we describe the cultivation and characterization of strain CV58T, a novel member of the Gammaproteobacteria order Pseudomonadales isolated from the guts of the ant Cephalotes varians. Strain CV58T was rod-shaped, Gram-stain-negative, non-motile and formed pale-yellow colonies on trypticase soy agar. Optimum growth occurred under an atmosphere of 4-20 % (v/v) O2. Growth was possible for strain CV58Tat NaCl concentrations of 0-1.5 % (w/v), temperatures of 23-40 °C, and pH values of 5.5-8.5. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 54.9 mol% and the major fatty acids were C18 : 1ω7c, C16 : 0, C16 : 1ω7c/C16 : 1ω6c, C12 : 0 and C12 : 03OH. The only respiratory quinone detected was ubiquinone-9 (Q-9) and the major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence, strain CV58T shared an 88.3 % nucleotide identity with its closest cultivated neighbor, Pseudomonas putida R43. We believe that this, combined with the housekeeping gene phylogeny, differences in phenotypic characteristics and cellular fatty acid compositions of other cultivated members indicates that strain CV58T represents a novel species occupying a novel genus and family within the order Pseudomonadales. Thus, we propose the name Ventosimonadaceae fam nov., followed by Ventosimonas gracilis gen. nov., sp. nov., to classify strain CV58T (=NCIMB 15011T =DSM 100910T).\n\nPMID:27054961", 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

Cells of the two strains were motile, pleomorphic rods, stained Gram-variable and produced red-pigmented colonies.
