Abstract:
This review covers some recent advances in application of omics technologies to studying methylotrophs, with special reference to their activities in natural environments. Some of the developments highlighted in this review are the new outlook at the role of the XoxF-type, lanthanum-dependent methanol dehydrogenase in natural habitats, new mechanistic details of methane oxidation through the reverse methanogenesis pathway, propensity of 'aerobic' methanotrophs to thrive in hypoxic environments and potential connection of this process to denitrification, and a novel outlook at methane oxidation as a community function.
