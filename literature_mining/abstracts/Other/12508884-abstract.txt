{'content': 'Streptomyces avermectinius sp. nov., an avermectin-producing strain.\n\nWe propose the establishment of a new species, Streptomyces avermectinius, based on characterization of strain MA-4680(T) and morphological and phylogenetic comparisons with closely related members of the genus Streptomyces. The 16S rDNA sequence was obtained from this strain and used to place it among Streptomyces species using the variable alpha region and the nearly complete 16S rDNA sequence. Four Streptomyces species were selected as related species from phenotypic data, three species from phylogenetic databases on alpha region sequences and two species from phylogenetic data using nearly complete 16S rDNA sequences. Analysis of DNA-DNA hybridization tests distinguished strain MA-4680(T) from these eight Streptomyces species. The type strain is strain MA-4680(T) (= ATCC 31267(T) = NRRL 8165(T)).\n\nPMID:12508884', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
