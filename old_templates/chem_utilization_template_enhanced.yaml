          Extract ALL organism-compound relationships from the text, including:
          fermentation (e.g., "organism ferments compound"), 
          production (e.g., "organism produces compound"),
          utilization (e.g., "organism utilizes compound"),
          reduction (e.g., "organism reduces compound"),
          oxidation (e.g., "organism oxidizes compound"),
          metabolism (e.g., "organism metabolizes compound"),
          growth on substrates (e.g., "organism grows on compound"),
          negative relationships (e.g., "organism does not ferment compound"),
          contains/composition (e.g., "organism contains compound").
          Look for verbs like: ferments, produces, utilizes, reduces, oxidizes, metabolizes, grows on, contains, degrades, transforms, converts.
          Also extract negative relationships using "does not" or "but not".
