Abstract
Persistent environmental pollutants demand the use of diverse
microbial metabolic capabilities for effective degradation. While
naturally occurring consortia or single strains often fall short in
efficiency, synthetic microbial communities (SynComs) hold greater
promise for enhanced degradation. To address this challenge, we
developed GENIA (Genomically and Environmentally Networked
Intelligent Assemblies), a genome-informed and machine learning–
guided framework for the rational design of SynComs capable of
multi-pollutant degradation under simulated environmental
conditions. Using a microfluidic high-throughput cultivation
platform, 2,155 bacterial strains were isolated from xenobioticenriched environments and screened for pollutant-specific growth.
Whole-genome sequencing and functional annotation of 45
prioritized strains revealed metabolic traits associated with the
potential degradation of challenging persistent environmental
pollutants as proof of concept, i.e., lignin oxidation, atrazine
dechlorination, and PFAS defluorination. These genomic profiles
were encoded into spline-based graph representations and
integrated within the GENIA pipeline, which combines graph neural
networks, pathway complementarity modeling, and functional
redundancy minimization to predict optimal community assemblies.
The resulting nine-member community—comprising Pantoea
dispersa, Atlantibacter hermannii, Pseudomonas fulva, Paenibacillus
polymyxa, Bacillus cabrialesii, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus
pseudomycoides, Bacillus licheniformis, and Pseudomonas pergaminensis
—was predicted to exhibit broad catabolic capacity and minimal
intra-community competition. Kinetic experiments in minimal
medium demonstrated simultaneous multi-pollutant degradation:
lignin (91.6% removal by day 5), atrazine (91.4% removal by day
3), and PFOS (93.1% removal within seven days), representing a
2-4-fold improvement over existing approaches. GENIA establishes
a scalable and generalizable framework that integrates systemslevel genomics, phenotypic screening, and predictive modeling to
engineer ecologically coherent microbial consortia with application
to complex environmental bioremediation.
