Methylobacterium species colonize plant surfaces and utilize methanol emitted from plants. Methylobacterium aquaticum
strain 22A was isolated from a hydroponic culture of a moss, Racomitrium japonicum, and is a potent plant growth promoter.
The complete genome sequencing of the strain conﬁrmed the presence of genes related to plant growth promotion and
methylotrophy.

M
ethylobacterium species are known as one of the predominant bacterial species that inhabit plant surfaces (1). Plants
emit methanol as a product of pectin demethylation (2). The
methylotrophic characteristics of the genus confer an advantage
for survival in the phyllosphere (3). Some species have been reported to be capable of promoting plant growth (4, 5). Methylobacterium aquaticum strain 22A was isolated from a hydroponic
culture sample of Racomitrium japonicum and shown to be a potent growth promoter for various plants (5). The strain belongs to
a new lineage of the genus Methylobacterium, because its 16S
rRNA gene sequence showed low homology with that of its closest
type strain, M. aquaticum (98.506%) (6). The genome of strain
22A was completely sequenced in this work.
Genome sequencing of the fragment library (size, 900 bp; total,
146 million bp; 316,194 reads) and paired-end library (size, 8 kbp;
total, 69 million bp; 156,789 reads) was performed using the FLX
454 genome sequencer. Additional sequencing data were obtained
with an Illumina 500-bp paired-end library (117 million bp,
816,704 reads). Assembly was done with Newbler version 3.0, resulting in 9 scaffolds with 134 contigs at 47 coverage. Gaps were
closed in silico using GenoFinisher (7) and by sequencing of the
PCR products bridging the scaffolds and contigs. Finally, the total
genome size was found to be 7,557,960 bp (GC content, 69.1%),
with a circular chromosome (5,348,274 bp; GC content, 71.1%)
and ﬁve circular plasmids (i.e., pMaq22A-1, 1,571,989 bp [70.9%
GC content]; pMaq22A-2, 462,889 bp [67.5% GC content];
pMaq22A-3, 85,702 bp [67.8% GC content]; pMaq22A-4,
50,170 bp [70.3% GC content]; and pMaq22A-5, 38,936 bp
[66.72% GC content]).
The identiﬁcation of protein-coding sequences (CDSs) and
annotation were carried out using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome
Annotation
Pipeline
(PGAP)
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
/genome/annotation_prok/) and the Microbial Genome Annotation Pipeline (MiGAP) (http://www.migap.org). The CDSs that
were inconsistent between the two pipelines were manually corrected using GenomeMatcher (7). The predicted number of CDSs
was 6,944. Ten rrn operons were found in the chromosome and
one in pMaq22A-1. Eighty-three tRNA genes were found in the
chromosome, and 12 were in pMaq22A-1. Thus, it may be possible to consider pMaq22A-1 the second chromosome.
We identiﬁed almost all important genes encoding proteins
involved in methylotrophy (8, 9): methanol dehydrogenases (MxaFI and XoxF), methylotrophy regulatory proteins (MxcQE and
MxbDM), and PQQ synthesis enzymes (PqqA1A2BCDE, pqqA
gene is duplicated, and PqqFG are encoded in distant loci). We
also identiﬁed the genes important for interaction with plants:
trans-zeatin production (miaA), cobalamin synthesis (cob),
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (acdS), siderophore production (rhbC), and ﬁve copies of ﬂagellin genes (ﬂaLabcde), but no nitrogenase gene. Nif genes were found in nitrogenﬁxing Methylobacterium nodulans and Methylobacterium populi
(10, 11), which is consistent with the fact that this strain is not
diazotrophic. The functions of these genes are under investigation. The genome information of the strain will allow both further
functional and comparative genome analyses among the genus
Methylobacterium and the establishment of a novel species to
which the strain belongs to as a new lineage.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The complete genome data have been deposited in DDBJ under the accession
numbers AP014704 to AP014709. The versions described in this
paper are the ﬁrst versions, AP014704.1 to AP014709.1.
