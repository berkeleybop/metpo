{'content': 'Paenibacillus panaciterrae sp. nov., isolated from ginseng-cultivated soil.\n\nA novel bacterium, designated DCY95T, was isolated from ginseng-cultivated soil in Quang Nam province, Vietnam. On the basis of 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequence analysis, this isolate was assigned to the genus Paenibacillus and found to be closely related to Paenibacillus sacheonensis SY01T (97.1 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Paenibacillus taihuensis THMBG22T (96.4 %). The partial gyrB gene of DCY95T possessed 69.6-83.9 % sequence identity to those of other members of the genus Paenibacillus. Strain DCY95T was Gram-reaction-negative, catalase-negative, oxidase-positive, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped and motile by means of peritrichous flagella. Ellipsoidal free spores or subterminal endospores were produced in sporangia. MK-7 was the diagnostic menaquinone. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diamonopimelic acid as the diamino acid. Whole-cell sugars comprised ribose, mannose and glucose. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C16 : 0 and C16 : 0. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, three unidentified aminophospholipids, and two unidentified phospholipids. The genomic DNA G+C content was 60.7 Â± 0.9 mol%. Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic results placed strain DCY95T within the genus Paenibacillus. However, DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain DCY95T and P. sacheonensis KACC 14895T or P. taihuensis NBRC 108766T were lower than 36 %. The low DNA relatedness data in combination with phylogenetic and (GTG)5-PCR analyses, as well as biochemical tests, indicated that strain DCY95T could not be assigned to any recognized species. In conclusion, the results in this study support the classification of strain DCY95T as a representative of a novel species within the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus panaciterrae is proposed. The type strain is DCY95T ( = KCTC 33581T = DSM 29477T).\n\nPMID:26294902', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
