N.L. gen. n. <em>usgae</em> of USGA, the acronym for the United States Golf Association, in gratitude for their financial support to study this potential biological control agent against <em>B. longicaudatus</em> in turfgrass ecosystems).</s></p><p class="description"><s>‘<em>Candidatus</em> Pasteuria usgae’ [(<em>Firmicutes</em>) NC; G+; M; NAS (GenBank no. AF254387), morphology (see following description); S (<em>Belonolaimus longicaudatus</em>, pseudocoelom)].</s><s>Obligate endoparasitic bacterium of the pseudocoelom of <em>B. longicaudatus</em> that cannot be cultivated on cell-free media, only by attachment of endospores to <em>B. longicaudatus</em> and co-cultivation on excised axenic root or greenhouse plant cultures.</s><s>Transmission occurs horizontally.</s><s>Host infection is via cuticular penetration by attached endospores that occurs on all stages of <em>B. longicaudatus</em> except eggs.</s><s>Sporogenesis, which leads to the death of the host, occurs in the pseudocoelom of J3 through adult stage nematodes.</s><s>Sporogenesis is typical of other nematode-specific <em>Pasteuria</em>.</s><s>Host range appears to be limited to <em>B. longicaudatus</em>, although attachment of endospores has been observed on <em>Belonolaimus euthychilus</em>, but not on other soil-inhabiting nematodes.</s><s>Organism is non-motile with Gram-positive vegetative phase.</s><s>Mycelium is septate, hyphal strands branch dichotomously with expansion of hyphal tip forming sporangium.</s><s>SEM observation shows that peripheral fibres of the mature endospore protrude around the exposed spherical outer coat of the spore creating a crenate border, as opposed to the other species of <em>Pasteuria</em> described from nematodes, which have no scalloped border.</s><s>The sporangium and central body diameters are on average at least 0·7 and 0·5 μm wider than these respective measurements for the other described species of <em>Pasteuria</em>.</s><s>In lateral view with TEM, the shape of the central body of S-1 is a rounded rectangle to a rounded trapezoid in transverse section, which contrasts with the circular shape of <em>P. ramosa</em>, the horizontally oriented elliptical shapes of <em>P. penetrans</em> and <em>P. nishizawae</em> and the rounded-square shape of <em>P. thornei</em>.</s><s>The outer spore coat is thickest laterally, thinner on top and thinnest across the bottom of the spore, being 7–8 times thicker laterally than along the bottom.</s><s>These measurements contrast with all other described species, having outer spore coats with relatively uniform thickness.</s><s>No basal ring exists in S-1 around the pore opening as in <em>P. penetrans</em>.</s><s>The outer coat wall thickness at its thickest point is &#x003E;15 % (both walls &#x003E;30 %) of the diameter of the central body, compared with 3 to &#x003C;13 % (both walls 6 to &#x003C;25 %) for the other described species of <em>Pasteuria</em>.</s><s>The epicortical wall remnant of the mature endospore occurs between the cortex and the inner spore coat in a sublateral band, similar to <em>P. thornei</em>, but different from the other three described species.</s><s>The epicortical walls in the other described species are as follows: completely concentric in <em>P. ramosa</em> and <em>P. nishizawae</em> and lateral in <em>P. penetrans</em>.</s></p></content></protolog>
