{'content': 'Aureimonas galii sp. nov. and Aureimonas pseudogalii sp. nov. isolated from the phyllosphere of Galium album.\n\nFour yellow-pigmented, Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped bacteria, strains PP-WC-4G-234T, PP-CE-2G-454T, PP-WC-1G-202 and PP-CC-3G-650, were isolated from the phyllosphere of Galium album. The strains shared 99.7-100 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity but could be differentiated by genomic fingerprinting using rep- and random amplification of polymorphic DNA PCRs. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene placed the strains within the family Aurantimonadaceae with highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 97.2-97.3 % to the type strain of Aureimonas phyllosphaerae. Sequence similarities to all other Aurantimonadaceae were below 97 %. The main cellular fatty acids of the strains were C18 : 1ω7c as the predominant fatty acid followed by C16 : 0 and summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω7c/C16 : 1ω8c). The polyamine patterns of strains PP-WC-4G-234T and PP-CE-2G-454T contained sym-homospermidine as a major compound, and the major respiratory quinone was ubiquinone Q-10. Predominant polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol, three unidentified phospholipids and one unidentified lipid only detectable after total lipid staining. The DNA G+C content was 66.4, 68.9, 67.4 and 70.5 mol% for strains PP-WC-4G-234T, PP-CE-2G-454T, PP-WC-1G-202 and PP-CC-3G-650, respectively. Based on phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic analyses we propose two novel species of the genus Aureimonas, Aureimonas galii sp. nov. with PP-WC-4G-234T (=LMG 28655T=CIP 110892T) as the type strain and Aureimonas pseudogalii sp. nov. with PP-CE-2G-454T (=LMG 29411T=CCM 8665T) as the type strain and two further strains representing the same species, PP-WC-1G-202 and PP-CC-3G-650.\n\nPMID:27255762', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
