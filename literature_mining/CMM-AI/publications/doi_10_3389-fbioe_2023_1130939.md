Biosorption of metal ions by phototrophic microorganisms is
regarded as a sustainable and alternative method for
bioremediation and metal recovery. In this study, 12 cyanobacterial
strains, including 7 terrestrial and 5 aquatic cyanobacteria, covering
a broad phylogenetic diversity were investigated for their potential
application in the enrichment of rare earth elements through
biosorption. A screening for the maximum adsorption capacity of
cerium, neodymium, terbium, and lanthanum was conducted in
which Nostoc sp. 20.02 showed the highest adsorption capacity with
84.2–91.5 mg g-1. Additionally, Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973,
Calothrix brevissima SAG 34.79, Desmonostoc muscorum 90.03, and
Komarekiella sp. 89.12 were promising candidate strains, with
maximum adsorption capacities of 69.5–83.4 mg g-1, 68.6–
83.5 mg g-1, 44.7–70.6 mg g-1, and 47.2–67.1 mg g-1 respectively.
Experiments with cerium on adsorption properties of the five
highest metal adsorbing strains displayed fast adsorption kinetics
and a strong influence of the pH value on metal uptake, with an
optimum at pH 5 to 6. Studies on binding specificity with mixedmetal solutions strongly indicated an ion-exchange mechanism in
which Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions are replaced by other metal
cations during the biosorption process. Depending on the
cyanobacterial strain, FT-IR analysis indicated the involvement
different functional groups like hydroxyl and carboxyl groups
during the adsorption process. Overall, the application of
cyanobacteria as biosorbent in bioremediation and recovery of rare
earth elements is a promising method for the development of an
industrial process and has to be further optimized and adjusted
regarding metal-containing wastewater and adsorption efficiency by
cyanobacterial biomass.
1 Introduction
Rare Earth Elements (REE) consist of scandium, yttrium, and 15
elements of the lanthanide series. These elements have exceptional
electromagnetic, catalytic, and optical properties making them
crucial for the production and development of modern high-

## Page 10

technology products. Due to their similar chemical properties,
separating REE demands sophisticated industrial processes that are
energy-intensive and use environmentally toxic chemicals (Haque et
al., 2014). Standard methods, for example, apply metal leaching
with acids or bases and extraction methods to purify REE (Opare et
al., 2021). Moreover, REE production is focused on a few countries,
resulting in an oligopoly that can dictate supply and price regimes.
REE are crucial for technology transition towards a renewable
energy-driven society. For instance, cerium or lanthanum have
applications in catalysts for air purification or chemical processing.
Other metals like neodymium or terbium are crucial for producing
permanent magnets or modern LEDs (Charalampides et al., 2015;
Shan et al., 2020). Hence, industrialized countries increasingly
focus on alternative supply routes and the development of cost and
ecologically compatible recycling routes. In this context, REE
recovered from dilute mining or industrial wastewater, as well as,
electronic waste streams are opening new, regional supply routes.
Establishing new biotechnologically based REE recovery methods
therefore leads to enhanced market stability and supply chain
independence for industrialized regions, such as the EU. Hence,
there is a growing interest in the recovery and recycling of REE
from industrial wastewater streams (Li et al., 2013; Barros et al.,
2019). Over the past decades, biosorption has been regarded as a
relatively simple and cost-efficient method for wastewater
treatment (Volesky 2001). It is a physicochemical process that
involves a solid phase (biosorbent) consisting of organic biomass
and a liquid phase containing the dissolved or suspended chemical
compounds to be sorbed (sorbate) (Fomina and Gadd 2014).
Biosorption has a wide range of potential applications in
wastewater remediation, including the removal of organic
substances like dyes, pharmaceuticals, or pesticides (Bell and Tsezos
1987; Aksu 2005; Crini and Badot 2008; Menk et al., 2019).
However, most research on biosorption in conjunction with the
removal of pollutants has been conducted on metals, including
heavy metals, actinides, and lanthanides (Dhankhar and Hooda
2011; Abbas et al., 2014; Giese 2020; Mattocks and Cotruvo 2020).
Yet, developed processes based on biosorption have not achieved a
commercial breakthrough. For example, it has been shown that
environmental factors, such as changes in the pH value, can alter
the affinity of biomass towards different elements (Zinicovscaia et

## Page 11

al., 2019). A low technology readiness level, including a poor
understanding of the underlying mechanisms, kinetics, and
thermodynamics of the process are areas that require more research
(Fomina and Gadd 2014; Elgarahy et al., 2021). It is widely
accepted that the chemical structure, in particular the composition
of functional groups on the cell surface, profoundly influences the
adsorption properties of biomass (Eccles 1999; Volesky 2007).
These active moieties may include hydroxyl-, carboxyl-, carbonyl-,
phosphate-, sulfonate-, amine-, amide-, and imide-groups, among
many others. Studies on biological, physical, or chemical
modification of biomass by adding functional groups have shown
that it is possible to improve binding specificity and capacity for
target sorbates (Wang and Chen 2006; Park et al., 2010; Abdolali et
al., 2015; Ciopec et al., 2020). Especially the recovery of REE with
chemically modified organic polymers has been the focus of recent
studies (Gabor et al., 2017; Negrea et al., 2018; Negrea et al.,
2020). Nevertheless, these resulting biosorbents are still inferior in
target selectivity to chemically synthesized ion-exchange resins with
a defined structure and composition (Gadd 2009). Due to the
heterogeneity of functional groups on the cell surface of microbial
biomass, binding specificity for elements remains a challenging
factor for industrial applicability. The adsorption of heavy metals
by eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria is well documented (Al-Amin
et al., 2021; Ankit et al., 2022). At present, the screening of new
species regarding biosorption and potential novel applications in
metal recovery remains of great interest due to high variability in
cell wall composition and structure, resulting in differences in
adsorption properties [e.g. (Micheletti et al., 2008)]. Cyanobacteria
have shown promising adsorption properties for heavy metals,
which could be used in the sequestration of metals from water on a
technical scale. If similar adsorption properties exist for the
bioremediation of REE has not been studied extensively yet.
Moreover, the adsorption properties of terrestrial cyanobacteria
were seldom investigated. Therefore, we taxonomically and
biotechnologically identified new and promising cyanobacterial
strains and evaluated their properties for REE adsorption. In this
context, we also aimed to correlate taxonomic identity and
adsorption characteristics. In this study, 12 cyanobacterial strains
with broad phylogenetic origin and inhabiting different ecological
habitats such as terrestrial, freshwater, and saltwater habitats were

## Page 12

investigated for their potential applicability in an adsorption
process for the enrichment of REE. Their phylogenetic relationship
was determined using 16S rRNA sequences. The screening for
maximum adsorption capacity with four different REE (i.e.
lanthanum, cerium neodymium, and terbium), as well as the effect
of several parameters on biosorption, including initial pH value,
incubation time, and metal concentration for cerium, were
evaluated. Additionally, binding specificity for cerium in the
presence of other metal cations was investigated.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Cultivation of cyanobacteria
12 cyanobacterial strains with broad phylogenetic origins and from
different habitats were used for the study (Table 1). The cultures
were inoculated with approximately 0.1–0.3 g of wet biomass from
a stock culture (stored at 17°C and light, dark rhythm 16:8 h at
30 μmol photons m−2 s−1) in 1 L bubble columns containing BG11
cultivation medium (Stanier et al., 1971) (or Spirulina-medium for
Limnospira) (Andersen 2005) and cultivated at 23°C and light, dark
rhythm 16:8 h at 300 μmol photons m−2 s−1 photosynthetic
photon flux density). All cultivated cells were harvested using filters
(two sieves of 0.5 mm and 0.1 mm and finally paper filters of
40 µm openings), and wet biomass was dried by lyophilization.
Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 was cultivated in a 3.7 L
Labfors 5 Photobioreactor (Infors GmbH, Sulzemoos, DE) in BG11
medium at 37°C and constant illumination at 300 μmol photons
m−2 s−1. During cultivation, the pH was kept at eight by adding
CO2 gas. Biomass was harvested by centrifugation after reaching
the stationary phase.

study.

2.2 Phylogenetic characterization of strains
About 50 mg of biomass from all cultures were collected during
stationary growth phase and used for gDNA extraction with the
DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit (Quiagen, Hildesheim, Germany)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. The 16S–23S ITS gene
region was amplified by PCR in a 50 µL reaction using the primers
Wil1 and Wil18 (Wilmotte et al., 1993) and ready-to-go PCR mini
beads (GE Healthcare, Chicago, United Sates) in a MiniAmp Plus
Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, United Sates).
PCR products were checked by gel electrophoresis using 1% (w, v)
agarose and the E-Gel Power Snap Electrophoresis System
(Invitrogen, Waltham, United Sates). Subsequently, PCR products of
the expected length were purified with NucleSpin Gel and PCR
Clean-up Kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG, Düren, Germany)
following the DNA and PCR cleanup protocol and sent for Sanger
sequencing to Genewiz, Azenta (Germany GmbH, Leipzig, Germany)
using the primers Wil1, Wil4, Wil5, Wil10, Wil11, Wil16, and Wil18
(Wilmotte et al., 1993). The generated sequences were assembled
with Geneious Prime (v2021.0.1) software package (Biomatters
Limited, New Zealand) and compared to already submitted
sequences of those strains from public culture collections in terms
of authenticity using the BLAST tool of the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank. Sequences of strains
that are novel were submitted to GenBank, and their accession
numbers are given in the phylogenetic tree. The assembled 16S
rRNA gene sequences and related sequences of cyanobacterial
strains cited from GenBank were used for phylogenetic analyses,
including Gloeobacter violacaeus as outgroup for the 16S rRNA gene
alignment, applying the Muscle algorithm in Mega X (Kumar et al.,
2018). The evolutionary model that was best suited for the database
used was selected based on the lowest Akaike information criterion
value and calculated in Mega X which was the RGT G + I model of
nucleotide substitutions. The maximum likelihood method (ML)
with 1,000 bootstrap replications was calculated with Mega X and
Bayesian inference (BI) phylogenetic analyses, with two runs of
eight Markov chains executed for one million generations with
default parameters with MrBayes 3.2.1 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck
2003). Each analysis reached stationarity (average standard
deviation of split frequencies between runs <0.01) before the end

## Page 14

of the run.
2.3 Metal analysis
The metal concentration in the analyzed solutions was determined
via ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission
Spectrometry) (Agilent 725 Series ICP Optical Emission
Spectrometer, Agilent Technologies Inc., United Sates). A
TraceCERT® Rare earth element mix for ICP with 16 elements from
Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) and a
Certipur® ICP multi-element standard solution IV from Merck
(Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) with 23 elements, were used as
standards for calibration. Data analysis was done with ICP Expert II
Agilent 725-ES Instrument Software Version 2.0 (Agilent
Technologies Inc., United Sates).
2.4 Biosorption
Before the experiments, all biomass samples were washed three
times with demineralized water to remove residual media
components that could falsify the measurement results. The washed
biomass was frozen at −80°C and lyophilized. Sorption experiments
were carried out by incubating lyophilized biomass in metal
solutions with a defined concentration. Each experiment was
performed in triplicates. Metal uptake was determined by
comparing the metal concentrations before and after incubation.
Prior to measuring the metal concentration, each sample was
centrifuged at 10,000 rcf for 5 min at room temperature. The
supernatant was subsequently used for analysis. The adsorption
experiments in this study predominantly focused on cerium, as it is
the most prevalent REE.
2.5 Adsorption capacity
Adsorption experiments were performed based on a methodology
described in previous studies (Heilmann et al., 2015; Heilmann et
al., 2021). To determine the metal adsorption capacity (Q) of the
different strains, 10–20 mg of dry biomass of individual species
were weighed into centrifuge tubes and incubated in 2 mL metal
solutions for 3 h under constant shaking at room temperature.

## Page 15

Subsequently, the adsorption of the metals to the biomass was
determined by dividing the changes in metal concentration by the
amount of incubated biomass (see Eq. 1).
Q=ni−nfm=ci−cf×Vm(1)
with Q = adsorption capacity, ni = initial amount of substance, cf
= final amount of substance after incubation, ci = initial metal
concentration, cf = final metal concentration after incubation, V =
volume, and m = weight of biomass.
For the determination of the maximal adsorption capacity during
the screening, metal solutions with a concentration of 10 mM and
an initial pH value of 5 ± 0.2 were used.
2.6 Adsorption kinetics
Experiments on adsorption kinetic were carried out by varying the
incubation time of the biomass in cerium (III) nitrate solutions with
a concentration of 10 mM and a pH-value of 5 ± 0.2. Samples for
analysis were taken after an incubation time of 2 min, 5 min,
15 min, 30 min, and 60 min.
2.7 Effect of initial pH value
The influence of the pH value in metal biosorption was investigated
similarly to the method previously described. The pH value of the
applied metal solution was adjusted using hydrochloric acid and
sodium hydroxide. Due to the formation of insoluble REE
hydroxides at pH values above 7 (Plancque et al., 2003; Heilmann
et al., 2021) the experiments were carried out ranging from pH 1 to
6.
2.8 Adsorption isotherms
Adsorption isotherms were studied by varying the metal
concentration of solutions applied to the biomass samples between
0.5 and 10 mM. Samples were incubated for 1 h at room
temperature under constant shaking and analyzed as previously
stated. The adsorption isotherms were described using the Langmuir

## Page 16

and Freundlich model (see Eqs. 2, 3). The Langmuir model is often
used for the description of metal adsorption as it assumes
adsorption in the form of a monolayer onto a surface containing a
finite number of identical binding sites (Dada et al., 2012). By
contrast, the Freundlich model assumes metal adsorption on nonidentical bindings sites over a heterogeneous surface (Koong et al.,
2013).
Langmuir model: Qeq=QmaxK×Ceq1+K×Ceq(2)
Freundlich model: Qeq=KfCeqbf(3)
with Qeq = adsorption capacity at equilibrium, Qmax = maximum
adsorption capacity, K = Langmuir adsorption coefficient, Kf =
Freundlich adsorption capacity constant, Ceq = metal concentration
at equilibrium, and bf = Freundlich isotherm constant.
Calculations for data analysis and model fitting were done using
OriginPro 2020.
2.9 Adsorption specificity
Wastewater usually contains a mixture of different metal cations. In
addition to examining the capacity for a single element of interest,
it is therefore important to investigate whether some metal cations
are adsorbed preferentially over others by the cyanobacterial
biomass. Experiments were carried out with equimolar mixed-metal
solutions with concentrations of 0.5–4 mM to investigate the
binding specificity of the biomass for different metals. Following
previous experiments on green algae and cyanobacteria by Klimmek
(Klimmek 2003), the adsorption of cerium in the presence of
aluminum, lead, nickel, and zinc was investigated. The uptake of
metals by the biomass was measured using ICP-OES measurements,
analogous to determining the adsorption capacity with single metal
solutions.
2.10 FT-IR analysis
IR spectroscopy is a useful tool for the qualitative measurement of
organic functional groups. In this study, IR spectroscopy was used
to identify functional groups in cyanobacteria biomass samples and

## Page 17

to detect possible interactions with metal cations. Samples were
incubated in a cerium (III) nitrate solution (1 µmol 1 mg-1 biomass)
for 2 h and subsequently lyophilized. IR spectra were recorded
using a Nicolet iS50R FT-IR spectrometer from Thermo Fisher
Scientific (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, United Sates)
equipped with an iS50 ATR (Attenuated total reflection) multirange, diamond sampling station. For each sample, IR spectra were
obtained in a range from 400–4,000 cm-1.
3 Results
3.1 Phylogenetic analysis
Twelve different cyanobacteria, including four strains from public
culture collections and eight environmental isolates were
investigated. The identity of all strains from public culture
collections was confirmed based on their 16S rRNA sequence using
the BLAST tool of GenBank. The 16S rRNA sequences of the strains
97.20, 02.01, 90.01, 89.12, 20.02, and SAG 34.79 were originally
recovered, and their phylogenetic position was analyzed (Figure 1).
In detail, strains 90.01 and 89.12 clustered well supported within
the filamentous, heterocyte-forming genus Komarekiella while strain
20.02 clustered within the genus Nostoc sens. lat. The strain
Calothrix brevissima SAG 34.79 joined a cluster of other C. brevissima
strains and strains assigned to the genera Tolypothrix and Scytonema
with 100% identity. Strain 02.01 fell well supported in the large
cluster of Scytonema hyalinum, whereas strain 97.20 could be
assigned to Phormidium autumnale based on its high similarity with
16S rRNA sequences from other filamentous, non-heterocyte
forming strains representing this species. Thus, the cyanobacterial
strains represent a broad phylogenetic origin out of the three orders
Synechococcales, Oscillatoriales and Nostocales, inhabiting different
ecological habitats such as terrestrial, freshwater, and saltwater
habitats and most are new for biotechnological applications,
particularly for their adsorption process of REE.

shown. Supports at the nodes greater than 90% statistical support
from BI and ML represent posterior probabilities, and bootstrap
values indicated as blue circles. The scale bar specifies 0.1 expected
changes per site.
3.2 Screening for maximum adsorption capacity
In this study, the maximum adsorption capacity for REE (cerium,
neodymium, terbium, and lanthanum) of 12 different cyanobacteria
was investigated. The results of this screening are shown in Figure
2, depicting distinct differences in total metal uptake depending on
the species. There was no apparent correlation between the capacity
for REE adsorption for the phylogenetic relationship and the
ecological habitat. The highest overall metal uptake of the four
tested REE was observed for Nostoc sp. 20.02 adsorption capacities
between 84.2 and 91.5 mg g-1, while S. hyalinum 02.01 exhibited
the lowest maximum adsorption capacity with 15.5–21.2 mg g-1.
Based on these results, the biosorption properties of the five most
efficient cyanobacteria (Nostoc sp. 20.02, Synechococcus elongates
UTEX 2973, Desmonostoc muscorum 90.03, C. brevissima SAG 34.79,
and Komarekiella sp. 89.12) were investigated in more detail.

3.3 Effect of different initial pH values on metal
adsorption

## Page 19

The effect of the initial pH value of metal-solutions on biosorption
of REE was examined in a pH range between 1 and 6. Experiments
with 10 mM cerium (III) nitrate showed a strong influence of the
pH value on metal adsorption (Figure 3). The highest metal uptake
was observed at pH 5, with a minor decrease at pH 6. With
increasing acidity, metal adsorption rapidly decreased. At pH 1, no
notable metal adsorption was measured for all tested biomasses.
These results are in accordance with previous studies on
cyanobacteria, bacteria, and green algae regarding metal adsorption
(Kuyucak and Volesky 1988; Gong et al., 2005; Lupea et al., 2012;
Liang and Shen 2022).

3.4 Adsorption kinetics
As shown in Figure 4, metal adsorption for cerium (Ce3+) to all
tested cyanobacterial biomasses occurred rapidly. The adsorption
capacity equilibrium was reached within an incubation time of
5 minutes. After this time, there was no significant change in
adsorption capacity within 60 min.

biomasses for Ce3+ (Qce, mg Ce3+ g-1 dry mass) with incubations

3.5 Adsorption isotherms
For the intended application of cyanobacterial biomass for the
removal of metals from wastewater, high sorption capacities at
relatively low metal concentrations are beneficial. Sorption

## Page 20

capacities for the biomass of five selected cyanobacteria species
were investigated at concentrations between 0.5–10 mM. The
resulting data points were fitted according to the Langmuir and
Freundlich model. The best correlation was achieved using the
Langmuir model (Figure 5). Although the overall correlation with
the model was weak, maximum adsorption capacities predicted by
the model are in accordance with the values determined during the
screening experiments (Supplementary Tables S1, S2). Adsorption
capacities for all tested cyanobacteria exhibited a steep increase at
lower equilibrium metal concentrations, showing that sequestration
of metals is possible even at low concentrations.

3.6 Binding specificity
The binding specificity of cyanobacterial biomass towards cerium
was determined in adsorption experiments with other metals (Al,
Pb, Ni, and Zn) in equimolar solutions. Starting with a
concentration of 0.5 mM, the adsorption capacities were
investigated for increasing metal concentrations up to 4 mM. The
experiments showed that all elements could be adsorbed by the
tested biomass. However, the metal uptake for some elements
varied strongly amongst the tested metals (Figure 6). The
adsorption capacity for zink and nickel was the lowest, whereas for
cerium, the tested biomass showed the highest adsorption capacity
in solution with a concentration of 0.5–2.0 mM. Nevertheless, the
adsorption capacity for cerium in mixed metal solutions was
significantly lower compared to experiments with single-element
solutions in previous experiments. This indicates a competition of
different elements for the same, limited binding sites on the
biomass. The metal uptake of aluminum and lead steadily increased
with rising metal concentrations. At a metal concentration of 4 mM,

## Page 21

these elements even seemed to replace cerium as the binding
capacity for this element dropped for all tested cyanobacteria
biomasses. The analysis of metal concentrations via ICP-OES
revealed a release of alkaline and alkaline earth metals (Na, K, Mg,
and Ca) during the adsorption process. The concentration of these
elements increased after incubating the biomass in the equimolar
metal solutions containing Ce, Al, Pb, Ni, and Zn. By contrast,
mixing the biomass with pure demineralized water did not lead to a
notable increase in the concentration of alkaline and alkaline earth
metals. This indicates an ion-exchange mechanism in which
positively charged metal ions bind to the biomass and replace other
ions that exhibit a weaker interaction. For all tested cyanobacteria,
Na+ ions were the most prevalent ions being released. The biomass
of S. elongatus was an exception, as Mg2+ and Ca2+ played a more
important role in this case.

3.7 FT-IR analysis
IR spectra of all analyzed biomass samples displayed signals that
can be assigned to different functional groups (Figure 7). The broad
band in the region around 3,350 cm−1 in the spectra are linked to
the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups (Qian et al., 2018),
whereas the signal at 2,920 cm−1 can be related to the C-H
stretching vibrations of CH2 groups (Bhattacharya et al., 2014).
Signals around 1,630 cm-1, which can be assigned to C=O
stretching vibrations, indicate the presence of carboxyl groups
(Qian et al., 2009). The strong signals around 1,040 cm-1 can be
assigned to C-O stretching vibration in polysaccharides (Nakamoto
2009). FT-IR spectra of biomasses after interaction with cerium (III)
nitrate (Figure 7 blue lines) are characterized by changes in
intensity and shifts in position of certain bands due to the
interaction with the adsorbed metal ions. The first observed change

## Page 22

was the attenuation of intensity in the region between 3,600–
3,000 cm–1, indicating a decrease of free hydroxyl groups in the
biomass (Mitic-Stojanovic et al., 2011). This was most prominent in
biomass samples from D. muscorum 90.03 and Komarekiella sp.
89.12. Likewise, changes in intensities around 1,630 cm-1 and
1,040 cm-1 indicate an interaction with carboxyl groups (Qian et
al., 2009). These changes were more profound for S. elongates UTEX
2973, D. muscorum 90.03, and Komarekiella sp. 89.12. Distinct
changes in signal intensities around 1,410 cm-1 and 1,290 cm-1,
which can be observed in samples of Nostoc sp. 20.02, S. elongates
UTEX 2973, and C. brevissima SAG 34.79, might be linked to an
interaction with aromatic C-C groups and C-O or C-N groups
respectivly (Theivandran et al., 2015).

4 Discussion
4.1 Phylogenetic and taxonomical remarks
In the broad context of biotechnology, cyanobacterial strains are
often used without respecting their ecological niche. This is a
problem, because some taxa e.g. from aquatic habitats, often cannot
be used during biotechnological processes that involve heat or
desiccation, while others, such as terrestrial strains, are better
candidates and vice versa. In addition, it happens quite often that
results are not linked to strain identifiers or to wrongly identified
taxa what can lead to an incorrect comparison and interpretation of
data—a mistake that can remain uncorrected over decades (e.g.,
Jung et al., 2021b). For these reasons we respected the ecology of
the strains used in this study and depicted the phylogenetic
placement of the strains. This creates a transparent background for
the cyanobacterial strains that we used and allows others to better

## Page 23

compare their results. Besides publicly available cyanobacterial
strains with a clarified identity, several new isolates were
phylogenetically analyzed during this work based on their 16S
rRNA gene region (Figure 1). Among these were, for example, the
heterocytous, false-branching strain S. hyalinum 02.01 that joined
the large S. hyalinum cluster as outlined by Johansen et al.,
(Johansen et al., 2017). In addition, the two true-branching,
heterocytous strains Symphyonema bifilamentata 97.28 and
Reptodigitus sp. 92.1 were included in the study in order to
complement the setup of heterocytous, branching cyanobacteria.
The strain 97.28 was treated as Fisherella ambigua for the last 50
years of biotechnological research on secondary metabolites but
was recently re-assigned as the type strain of the genus
Symphyonema (Jung et al., 2021b). This strain has great
biotechnological potential, because it grows fast and produces a
diverse set of secondary metabolites, such as various ambigols
(summarized in (Jung et al., 2021b)). The strain 92.1 was formerly
treated as Nostochopsis lobatus, but doubts about this assignment
arose because N. lobatus is only known from aquatic habitats.
Recently, the new genus Reptodigitus was emerged, and the authors
pointed out that strain 92.1 needs to be correctly described as a
novel Reptodigitus species (Casamatta et al., 2020) which the
authors of this study will carry out in a follow up study. In contrast
to the above named strains, which are low producers of EPS
(extracellular polymeric substances), the genus Komarekiella and
related genera are well known to produce cells and filaments
covered by thick EPS sheaths (Scotta Hentschke et al., 2017; Soares
et al., 2021). EPS might play a role in metal adsorption (e.g. Al
Amin et al., 2021). However, the two strains investigated here are
the first strains of this genus described from a desert environment,
while the other species of the genus have multiple origins, including
lichen symbioses (Jung et al., 2021a; Soares et al., 2021; Panou and
Gkelis 2022). All of them have a very complex life cycle in common
that can hamper biotechnological applications due to different
metabolic activity depending on the developmental stage of the
culture. Also, the two strains 90.01 and 89.12 will be described as
new species in the future. More challenging to interpret are the
phylogenetic and taxonomical positions of Nostoc sp. 20.02 and C.
brevissima SAG 34.79 (Figure 1). The strain 20.02 was isolated as an
epiphyte on a cyanolichens and can be considered as a Nostoc strain

## Page 24

not involved in the symbiosis because most true Nostoc lichen
photobionts usually join distinct Nostoc ‘photobiont clusters’ based
on their 16S rRNA (O'Brien et al., 2005). The overall taxonomic
position of this strain remains unsure as it also does not cluster
within the Nostoc sensu stricto clade. Similar uncertainties affect
strain SAG 34.79 that could be assigned to C. brevissima based on its
morphology and phylogenetic position, although there is no
cohesive cluster formed and no type strain for the genus deposited.
Closely related strains such as Tolypothrix tenuis SAG 94.79,
Scytonema mirabile SAG 83.79, and T. tenuis J1 (Figure 1) need
further investigation to clarify the state of the genus. Calothrix
exhibits a notorious morphological heterogeneity and extreme
polyphyly, which is evident from various independent clades in the
phylogenetic trees of past research [reviewed in (Nowruzi and
Shalygin 2021)]. However, even if no phylogenetic or habitat
correlation with adsorption capacity could be found,
biotechnological studies of cyanobacterial strains should be more
often accompanied with phylogenetical studies applying the current
standard for taxonomical classification by the so called polyphasic
approach (Komárek et al., 2014) to identify taxonomic
rearrangements and to avoid confusion regarding species names and
strain names from culture collections for biotechnology.
4.2 Metal adsorption experiments
For microalgae, the bioremediation, bioaccumulation, or
biosorption of common heavy metals such as Pb, Cd, Cr, As, Hg, Ni,
etc. is often studied [e.g. (Ahuja et al., 1999; Ç etinkaya Dönmez et
al., 1999; Mehta and Gaur 2005)]. The mechanisms behind these
adsorption processes vary with species and environmental
conditions (Kumar et al., 2015). However, different mechanisms are
discussed, such as ion exchange, complexation, electrostatic
attraction, and micro-precipitation (Kumar et al., 2015; Yadav et
al., 2021). In contrast, the biosorption of REE is studied less. For the
adsorption process of REE, the results in this study indicate an ionexchange mechanism in which cations of alkaline and alkaline earth
metals (Na, K, Mg, and Ca) are replaced by other metal cations
during the biosorption process with cyanobacterial biomass (Figure
6). This is in agreement with previous experiments using biomass of
different microorganisms (Crist et al., 1994; Matheickal et al., 1997;

## Page 25

Sulaymon et al., 2013; Liang and Shen 2022). Ion exchange has
been proposed as a dominant mechanism during biosorption (Chen
et al., 2002; Iqbal et al., 2009). Apart from Synechocococcus
elongates UTEX 2973 biomass, sodium was the predominant element
during the ion exchange process. This differs from previous reports
in which cations of earth alkaline metals were released in higher
percentages (Iqbal et al., 2009; Sulaymon et al., 2013).
Additionally, studies reported the replacement of protons with
metal cations leading to a decrease in pH during the sorption
process (Mashitah et al., 1999; Vasudevan et al., 2002). However,
this aspect was not focused on in the experimental setup of this
study. The strong influence of pH value on metal uptake shown in
this study further emphasizes the correlation between charges on
the surface of the biosorbent and the adsorbed metal ions. In
previous studies, the effect of pH value on biosorption has been
confirmed (García-Rosales et al., 2012; Abdel-Aty et al., 2013). At
low pH values, functional groups on the cell surface are either
neutral or positively charged. Carboxyl groups for instance are
protonated at pH values below 3, whereas amino groups are
protonated at pH 4.1 (Eccles 1999). As similar charges create a
repulsive force, positive charges on the biomass surface repel metal
cations, leading to poor metal uptake at low pH values. Previous
studies described a strong influence of hydroxyl and carboxyl
groups on the adsorption process for different biomasses (Gupta and
Rastogi 2008; Luo et al., 2010; Utomo et al., 2016). Experiments on
adsorption kinetics showed a quick metal uptake for all tested
biomasses, reaching equilibrium within only a few minutes. In
general, the process of metal cations attaching to adsorbents with a
mesoporous surface involves two stages (Zinicovscaia et al., 2021).
Specifically, the steps involve the migration of ions from the main
solution to the boundary layer surrounding the intermediate-pore
matrices, and the attachment of the metal ions to the active sites of
the adsorbent material via adsorption. Previous studies have
reported fast kinetics for the adsorption of metals on biomass of
other green algae and cyanobacteria (Klimmek et al., 2001). On the
other hand, experiments in other studies resulted in incubation
times of up to 60 min and more before reaching the maximum
adsorption equilibrium (Ahuja et al., 1999; Zinicovscaia et al.,
2017). Fast metal uptake is a beneficial factor for the process
development beyond laboratory scale as long incubation periods

## Page 26

can be avoided, and higher flow rates can be achieved. Adsorption
experiments with equimolar mixed-metal solutions were carried
out, revealing a preference for certain elements influenced by the
total metal concentration. The tested biomasses showed the highest
overall adsorption capacity for Ce3+ at low metal concentrations.
However, cations of these elements were replaced by Pb and Al at
higher metal concentrations (2–4 mM) in this experimental setup.
Zn and Ni showed to lowest affinity to the tested biomasses. Similar
results have been reported for biomass of other microorganisms
(Klimmek 2003; Wilke et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2018). At present,
our ability to make predictions on binding specificity based on
single-element adsorption experiments is limited (Wilke et al.,
2006). Regarding a potential industrial application for the recovery
of REE, these are promising results, as metal concentrations usually
are lower than the highest concentrations in the experimental setup
of this study. Furthermore, it should be considered that this study
predominately focused on the adsorption of the element cerium.
Due to high chemical similarities between REE, it is likely that the
adsorption properties of the tested biomasses will be similar for
other elements of this group. Nevertheless, additional experiments
with other REE are advisable. Target elements could be extracted
from the resulting metal-loaded biomass in follow-up processes. The
destructive recovery by combustion, resulting in metal-enriched
ash, is a simple method with the drawback of losing the initial
biomass. An economically more desirable approach is the targeted
desorption of elements from loaded biomass, enabling the recycling
of the biosorbent. Previous studies have tested various approaches
using different acids or complexing agents (Gong et al., 2005;
Abdolali et al., 2015). Unfortunately, the adsorption properties of
biosorbents are impaired over the curse of a few cycles (Hammaini
et al., 2007). Future studies should address the binding specificity
and durability of biosorbents to implement biosorption in industrial
processes successfully. In competitive systems, the adsorption of
different metal cations on biomass is influenced by functional
groups on the cell surface. The interaction between metal cations
and functional groups still requires more research. According to the
current state of knowledge, various ionic properties of metal
cations, such as electronegativity, redox potential, and ionic radius
can influence the adsorption on biomass (Naja et al., 2010).
Depending on the biomass and physico-chemical conditions,

## Page 27

multiple mechanisms may be involved in metal sorption
simultaneously (Gadd 2009). With respect to different
cyanobacterial strains, FT-IR analysis indicated the involvement of
various functional groups during like hydroxyl or carboxyl groups
during metal adsorption. However, at present, there is no discrete
chemical entity that has been identified as dominant cell wall
feature that governs metal binding. In a previous study, for
instance, it was shown that complex polymeric sugars are involved
in the adsorption of terbium by C. brevissima (Jurkowski et al.,
2022). Cell wall-derived binding entities most likely vary for every
organism and metal presented.
5 Conclusion
In this study, a diverse group of 12 cyanobacteria was investigated
for their potential in the enrichment of REE in a biosorption
process. Metal uptake varied strongly among the tested strains, with
Nostoc sp. 20.02 showing the highest maximum adsorption capacity
of 84.2–91.5 mg g-1. However, there was no apparent correlation
between maximum adsorption capacity and phylogenetic
relationship nor for the ecological habitat of the strains. This could
be explained by variations in the composition of metal interacting
functional groups located at the cell surface. Moreover, many
cyanobacteria that showed high adsorption capacities for REE
produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that are known to
facilitate metal adsorption (Pagliaccia et al., 2022). The
composition of these EPS and their influence on the adsorption of
REE should be further investigated in future studies. The
determination of relevant parameters for improving the metal
uptake revealed a pH optimum at 5 to 6 and fast adsorption kinetics
reaching adsorption equilibrium within an incubation time of a few
minutes. In addition, metal analysis strongly indicated an ionexchange mechanism during the biosorption process in which Na+,
K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions are replaced by metal cations that bind
to the surface of the biomass. These observations are in accordance
with previous studies that were conducted on algal, bacterial, and
other biomasses (Acheampong et al., 2011; Sulaymon et al., 2013;
Liang and Shen 2022). The isolation of single target elements in a

## Page 28

technical biosorption process remains a challenging task due to the
complex surface structure and the heterogeneity of functional
groups. Nevertheless, based on the results of this study, the
enrichment of metal elements from diluted solutions is possible. For
the development of an industrial process, parameters need to be
further optimized and adjusted depending on the metal composition
in the wastewater and the biomass that is used as biosorbent.
