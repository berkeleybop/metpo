{'content': 'Klenkia sesuvii sp. nov., isolated from leaves of halophyte Sesuvium portulacastrum.\n\nDuring a study on the diversity of culturable actinobacteria from coastal halophytes in Thailand, strain LSe6-5T was isolated from leaves of sea purslane (Sesuvium portulacastrum L.), and a polyphasic approach was employed to determine its taxonomic position. The 16S rRNA gene sequences analysis indicated that the strain was most closely related to Klenkia brasiliensis Tu 6233T (99.2 %), Klenkia marina YIM M13156T (99.1 %), and Klenkia terrae PB261T (98.7 %). The genome of strain LSe6-5T was estimated to be 4.33 Mbp in size, with DNA G+C contents of 74.3%. A phylogenomic tree based on whole-genome sequences revealed that strain LSe6-5T formed a clade with Klenkia marina DSM 45722T, indicating their close relationship. However, the average nucleotide identity (ANI)-blast, ANI-MUMmer, and dDDH values between strain LSe6-5T with K. marina DSM 45722T (87.1, 88.9, and 33.0 %) were below the thresholds of 95-96 % ANI and 70 % dDDH for identifying a novel species. Furthermore, strain LSe6-5T showed morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics of the genus Klenkia. Cells were motile, rod-shaped, and Gram-stain-positive. Optimal growth of strain LSe6-5T occurred at 28 Â°C, pH 7.0, and 0-3 % NaCl. The whole-cell hydrolysates contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid, with galactose, glucose, mannose, and ribose as whole-cell sugars. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H4) and MK-9(H0). The polar lipid profile was composed of diphosphatidylglycerol, hydroxyphosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, glycophosphatidylinositol, an unidentified phospholipid, and an unidentified lipid. Major cellular fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0, iso-C16 : 0, and iso-C17 : 0. From the distinct phylogenetic position and combination of genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, it is supported that strain LSe6-5T represents a novel species of the genus Klenkia, for which the name Klenkia sesuvii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain LSe6-5T (=TBRC 16417T= NBRC 115929T).\n\nPMID:38832855', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
