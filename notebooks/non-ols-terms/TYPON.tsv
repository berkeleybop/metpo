<http://purl.phyloviz.net/ontology/typon#Genotypic>	"Genotypic"		"Genotypic characterizes all the Typing Information that is based directly on the sequence itself or properties (such as sequence length)."
<http://purl.phyloviz.net/ontology/typon#MLST>	"MLST"		"MLST stands for Multilocus Sequence Typing and it is a sequence based typing method that traditionally focused on the sequence of seven housekeeping loci to determine the phylogenetic relationships between strains of the same species. The novel Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) techniques are bringing new approaches to MLST moving from traditional 7-loci approches to schemas containing up to thousands of genes (see rMLST, wgMLST,cgMLST).

<http://purl.phyloviz.net/ontology/typon#MLVA>	"MLVA"		"MLVA stands for Multilocus Variable Number of Tandem Repeats Analysis. This method can be performed by three distinct methodologies: by running the amplified locus in a gel , using a capilary electrophoresis apparatus or sequencing the resulting amplified fragment. The first two infer the number of repeats on each locus indirectly by the fragment size."
