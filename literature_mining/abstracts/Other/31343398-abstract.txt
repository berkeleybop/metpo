{'content': "Sphingomonas ginkgonis sp. nov., isolated from phyllosphere of Ginkgo biloba.\n\nStrain HMF7854T, isolated from a ginkgo tree, was an orange-pigmented, Gram-stain-negative, motile by means of a single flagellum, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium. The isolate grew optimally on Reasoner's 2A agar at 30 °C, pH 7.0-8.0 and 0 % NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain HMF7854T belonged to the genus Sphingomonas and was most closely related to Sphingomonasagri HKS-06T (96.8 % sequence similarity). The major fatty acids were C17 : 1 ω6c, summed feature 8 (C18 : 1ω7c and/or C18 : 1ω6c), summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω7c and/or C16 : 1ω6c) and C16 : 0. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone-10. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, sphingoglycolipid, two unidentified lipids and two unidentified glycolipids. The genomic DNA G+C content was 68.4 mol%. Thus, based on its phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data, strain HMF7854T represents a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonasginkgonis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the species is strain HMF7854T (=KCTC 62461T=NBRC 113337T).\n\nPMID:31343398", 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
