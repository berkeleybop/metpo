# üö® CRITICAL FINDING: Culture Temperature and pH Data Not Being Extracted

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Discovery:** Schema analysis revealed structured paths for temperature and pH that kg-microbe is NOT extracting

> **Documentation Note:**  
> Earlier documents (`bacdive_keywords_analysis.md` and `keywords_without_structured_paths.md`) incorrectly stated that temperature keywords had no structured path equivalents. This document provides the corrected information. Those documents have been updated with cross-references to this correction.

## The Discovery

While analyzing the BacDive schema (`bacphen-awareness/data/output/.../bacdive_strains_genson_schema.json`), I discovered:

### 1. Culture Temperature Path EXISTS!

**Path:** `Culture and growth conditions.culture temp`

**Structure:**
```json
{
  "@ref": 5523,
  "growth": "positive",
  "type": "growth",      // or "optimum", "minimum", "maximum"
  "temperature": "37"     // degrees Celsius
}
```

**Data availability:**
- **49,507 strains** have culture temp data (49.8% of dataset!)
- Multiple temperature measurements per strain (growth, optimum, min, max)
- Types: growth (87,461), optimum (7,775), maximum (197), minimum (157)

**Current situation:**
- ‚úÖ Constants defined in kg-microbe (`CULTURE_TEMP`, `CULTURE_TEMP_TYPE`, etc.)
- ‚ùå **NOT being extracted** in bacdive.py
- ‚ùå Using keywords instead ("mesophilic", "thermophilic", etc.)

### 2. Culture pH Path EXISTS!

**Path:** `Culture and growth conditions.culture pH`

**Structure:**
```json
[
  {
    "@ref": 22964,
    "ability": "positive",
    "type": "growth",
    "pH": "3.7-7.6",
    "PH range": "acidophile"  // or "alkaliphile"
  },
  {
    "@ref": 22964,
    "ability": "positive",
    "type": "optimum",
    "pH": "5.0-6.5"
  }
]
```

**Data availability:**
- **6,796 strains** have culture pH data (6.8% of dataset)
- Types: growth (6,918), optimum (5,864), minimum (118), maximum (107)
- pH range categories: alkaliphile (4,034), acidophile (263)

**Current situation:**
- ‚ùå No constants defined in kg-microbe
- ‚ùå **NOT being extracted** in bacdive.py
- ‚ùå Using keywords or custom pH ranges instead

## Comparison: Structured Paths vs Keywords

### Temperature

| Source | Strains | Detail Level | Current Status |
|--------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Structured path** | 49,507 | Specific ¬∞C values + type (growth/optimum/min/max) | ‚ùå **NOT EXTRACTED** |
| **Keywords** | 45,135 | Category only (mesophilic/thermophilic/psychrophilic/hyperthermophilic) | ‚úÖ Extracted |

**Correlation:** Nearly 100% of keyword strains also have structured data!
- mesophilic: 42,236 total, **42,197 (99.9%)** have culture temp data
- thermophilic: 1,530 total, **1,529 (99.9%)** have culture temp data
- psychrophilic: 1,190 total, **1,189 (99.9%)** have culture temp data
- hyperthermophilic: 179 total, **179 (100%)** have culture temp data

### pH

| Source | Strains | Detail Level | Current Status |
|--------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Structured path** | 6,796 | Specific pH values + type (growth/optimum/min/max) + category (acidophile/alkaliphile) | ‚ùå **NOT EXTRACTED** |
| **Keywords** | 0 | N/A - pH preference not in keywords | ‚ùå Not in keywords |
| **Custom ranges** | ? | pH ranges from BactoTraits/custom_curies.yaml | ‚úÖ From other sources |

## What kg-microbe is Missing

### Temperature Data

**Currently extracting:**
- Temperature **category** from keywords (mesophilic, etc.)

**Could be extracting from structured path:**
1. **Specific temperature values** (37¬∞C, 25¬∞C, etc.)
2. **Temperature type** (growth temp vs optimum vs min/max)
3. **Temperature ranges** (e.g., "30-37¬∞C", "10-37¬∞C")
4. **Multiple measurements** per strain

**Example psychrophilic strain (BacDive-ID: 82):**
- Keyword: "psychrophilic" (category)
- Structured data:
  - Growth temp: 20¬∞C
  - Growth range: 2.0-30.0¬∞C
  - Optimum: 20.0-25.0¬∞C

The structured data is **much richer** than the keyword!

### pH Data

**Currently extracting:**
- pH ranges from BactoTraits (via custom_curies.yaml)
- Nothing from BacDive keywords (pH keywords don't exist)

**Could be extracting from structured path:**
1. **Specific pH values** (e.g., "5.0-6.5", "3.7-7.6")
2. **pH type** (growth pH vs optimum vs min/max)
3. **pH preference category** (acidophile, alkaliphile) - **this is in the data!**
4. **Multiple measurements** per strain

---

## Why This Matters

### 1. Data Richness

**Temperature example:**
- **Before:** organism ‚Üí has_phenotype ‚Üí "mesophilic"
- **After:**
  - organism ‚Üí has_phenotype ‚Üí "mesophilic"
  - organism ‚Üí growth_temperature ‚Üí 37¬∞C
  - organism ‚Üí optimum_temperature ‚Üí 35-40¬∞C
  - organism ‚Üí temperature_range ‚Üí 20-45¬∞C

### 2. Data Coverage

- **Temperature:** 49,507 strains with structured data vs 45,135 with keywords
  - **4,372 additional strains** could get temperature data!

### 3. Quantitative Analysis

Structured data enables:
- Grouping organisms by exact temperature ranges
- Finding organisms that grow at specific temperatures
- Correlating temperature with other phenotypes
- More precise ecological niche modeling

### 4. Consistency

Using structured paths is more consistent with kg-microbe's approach for:
- Oxygen preference (uses `Physiology.oxygen tolerance`)
- Spore formation (uses `Physiology.spore formation`)
- Cell shape (uses `Morphology.cell morphology`)
- Gram stain (uses `Morphology.cell morphology`)

## Temperature Value Distribution

Top 20 temperature values in structured data:

| Temperature | Occurrences |
|-------------|-------------|
| 37¬∞C | 21,751 |
| 28¬∞C | 18,377 |
| 30¬∞C | 18,153 |
| 25¬∞C | 4,030 |
| 45¬∞C | 3,029 |
| 10¬∞C | 2,930 |
| 5¬∞C | 1,771 |
| 41¬∞C | 1,676 |
| 15¬∞C | 1,105 |
| 30-37¬∞C | 951 |
| 20¬∞C | 855 |
| 55¬∞C | 784 |
| 35¬∞C | 777 |
| 25-41¬∞C | 709 |
| 10-37¬∞C | 607 |
| 15-37¬∞C | 594 |
| 25-37¬∞C | 568 |
| 22¬∞C | 495 |
| 30-41¬∞C | 485 |
| 25-30¬∞C | 485 |

Note the mix of:
- Single values (37¬∞C)
- Ranges (30-37¬∞C)
- Both common temperatures (25-30¬∞C) and extreme (55¬∞C)

## pH Value Distribution

**pH categories in structured data:**
- alkaliphile: 4,034 occurrences
- acidophile: 263 occurrences
- null (not categorized): 4,200

**Example pH values:**
- "3.7-7.6" (wide range, acidophile)
- "5.0-6.5" (narrow optimum range)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Extract culture temperature data** from `Culture and growth conditions.culture temp`
   - Map temperature values to METPO or custom nodes
   - Extract by type: growth, optimum, minimum, maximum
   - Handle both single values and ranges
   - Keep keyword extraction as **additional/complementary** data

2. **Extract culture pH data** from `Culture and growth conditions.culture pH`
   - Map pH values to METPO pH range classes
   - Extract by type: growth, optimum, minimum, maximum
   - Use `PH range` field (acidophile/alkaliphile) to validate mappings

### Implementation Approach

#### Option A: Replace keyword extraction with structured path

**Pros:**
- More precise data
- Consistent with other phenotype extraction
- Covers more strains

**Cons:**
- Loses categorical labels (mesophilic, thermophilic, etc.)
- Need to infer categories from numeric values

#### Option B: Extract BOTH (RECOMMENDED)

**Pros:**
- Keep categorical labels from keywords
- Add precise numeric data from structured paths
- Maximum data coverage
- Users can query by category OR specific temperature

**Cons:**
- More edges in graph
- Potential redundancy

**Recommendation:** **Option B** - Extract both!
- Keywords give you: "mesophilic" (categorical phenotype)
- Structured path gives you: "grows at 37¬∞C" (quantitative measurement)

### Temperature Mapping Strategy

Create METPO classes or custom nodes for temperature observations:

```yaml
temperature_growth:
  temp_37:
    curie: "temp:growth_37"
    name: "growth at 37¬∞C"
    category: "biolink:Attribute"
    predicate: "biolink:has_attribute"

temperature_optimum:
  temp_opt_35_40:
    curie: "temp:optimum_35_40"
    name: "optimum temperature 35-40¬∞C"
    category: "biolink:Attribute"
    predicate: "biolink:has_attribute"
```

Or use METPO observation classes if they exist (METPO:1001001 optimum temperature observation, etc.)

### pH Mapping Strategy

The structured pH data has **categories built in** (`PH range` field):
- Map "acidophile" ‚Üí METPO acidophilic classes
- Map "alkaliphile" ‚Üí METPO alkaliphilic classes
- Map specific pH values ‚Üí METPO pH range classes

### Code Changes Needed

**In bacdive.py:**

1. Add extraction for `Culture and growth conditions.culture temp`:
```python
culture_temp = value.get(CULTURE_AND_GROWTH_CONDITIONS, {}).get(CULTURE_TEMP)
if culture_temp:
    # Extract temperature values and create nodes/edges
    # Similar to how we extract from Morphology.cell morphology
```

2. Add extraction for `Culture and growth conditions.culture pH`:
```python
culture_ph = value.get(CULTURE_AND_GROWTH_CONDITIONS, {}).get(CULTURE_PH)
if culture_ph:
    # Extract pH values and categories
    # Map acidophile/alkaliphile to METPO classes
```

3. Consider using `_process_phenotype_by_metpo_parent()` if METPO tree includes these paths

**In constants.py:**
- ‚úÖ Temperature constants already exist
- ‚ùå Need to add pH constants

**In METPO (metpo_sheet.tsv):**
- Check if temperature observation classes exist
- Add JSON paths for culture temp to appropriate parent nodes
- Check if pH observation classes exist
- Add JSON paths for culture pH to appropriate parent nodes

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Should we keep keyword extraction for temperature?**
   - My vote: YES - keywords give categorical labels, structured path gives quantitative data
   - Both are valuable

2. **How should we model temperature measurements?**
   - As METPO observations? (METPO:1001001, etc.)
   - As custom attribute nodes?
   - As literal values with units?

3. **Should we extract ALL temperature types?**
   - Growth temp (87,461 measurements)
   - Optimum temp (7,775 measurements)
   - Min/max temp (354 measurements)
   - My vote: YES to all

4. **How to handle temperature ranges like "30-37¬∞C"?**
   - Parse and create separate min/max nodes?
   - Keep as range string?
   - Both?

5. **pH categories are already in the data - should we prefer them over keyword mappings?**
   - Data has: "PH range" = "acidophile" or "alkaliphile"
   - These directly map to METPO classes
   - My vote: YES - use structured field preferentially

## Impact on Previous Analysis

This discovery **changes my previous conclusions**:

### What I Said Before

> "Temperature preference keywords (mesophilic, thermophilic, etc.) truly have NO structured alternative - this was a critical discovery that validates the kg-microbe implementation."

### What's Actually True

‚ùå **WRONG** - Temperature data DOES exist in structured paths!

‚úÖ **CORRECT** - kg-microbe's current use of keywords works, but it's leaving richer data on the table

### Updated Recommendation

1. ‚úÖ Keep keyword extraction (for categorical labels)
2. ‚úÖ **ADD** structured path extraction (for quantitative values)
3. ‚úÖ Extract both for maximum coverage and richness

---

## Urgency

**Priority Level: HIGH**

This affects:
- **49,507 strains** for temperature (49.8% of dataset)
- **6,796 strains** for pH (6.8% of dataset)
- Core phenotypic data that enables ecological analysis

The data is **already downloaded** - we just need to extract it!

---

## Validation

I verified this discovery by:
1. ‚úÖ Examining schema (bacphen-awareness schema file)
2. ‚úÖ Querying MongoDB (found 49,507 strains with culture temp)
3. ‚úÖ Examining sample records (confirmed structure)
4. ‚úÖ Checking correlation with keywords (99.9% overlap)
5. ‚úÖ Reviewing kg-microbe code (confirmed it's NOT being extracted)
6. ‚úÖ Checking constants file (found temp constants exist but unused)

This is **definitive** - the data exists and is not being used.

---

## Summary

**What we thought:** Temperature keywords are the only source ‚Üí ‚ùå INCORRECT

**What's true:**
- Temperature keywords: 45,135 strains, categorical labels
- Temperature structured data: 49,507 strains, quantitative values
- **Both are valuable and should be extracted!**

**Action needed:** Implement extraction from `Culture and growth conditions.culture temp` and `culture pH`

**Benefit:** Much richer phenotypic data enabling quantitative ecological analysis
