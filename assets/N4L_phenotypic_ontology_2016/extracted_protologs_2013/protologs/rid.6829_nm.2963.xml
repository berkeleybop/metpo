The species name <i>damsela</i> is taken from the modern zoological term damselfish and is treated as a modern Latin substantive in opposition to the name<i>Vibrio</i>. Thus, the species name does not have to agree in gender with the genus name)</s></p><p class="description"><s>The type strain of <i>V. damsela</i> is designated by Centers for Disease ,Control number 2588-80, which was deposited in the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md., as ATCC 33539. <i>Vibrio damsela</i> shares the properties of the genus Vibrio- its general pro,perties are (all data are based on the type strain incubated at 25°C unless otherwise indicated): Gram-negative rod; oxidase-positive; requires addition of NaCl to peptone media for growth; grows better at 25°C than at 37°C on initial isolation; grows well on thiosulfate citrate bile salts agar as 2- to 3-mm green colonies-guanine plus cytosine content of DNA (buoyant density method) is 43 mole percent, and is inhibited by O/129 disks (22-mm zone).</s><s>The properties that differentiate <i>V. damsela</i> from other <i>Vibrio</i> species are indole-negative, urease-positive; methyl red- and Voges-Proskauer- positive; arginine dihydrolase (Moeller's method's positive; lysine and ornithine decarboxylase-negative; gas produced during fermentation of carbohydrates; weakly motile- not bioluminescent; citrate not used as the sole source of carbon and energy; and only D-glucose, D-mannose, and maltose are fermented.</s><s>These properties are unique to <i>V. damsela</i> among the named species of <i>Vibrio</i> and <i>Photobacterium</i> [P.</s><s>Baumann, L.</s><s>Baumann, S.</s><s>S.</s><s>Bang, M.</s><s>J.</s><s>Woolkalis, Curr.</s><s>Microbiol. 4, 127 (1980)].</s><s>In addition, <i>V. damsela</i> also is distinct from all of the named species by DNA-DNA hybridization.</s><s>Other properties include positive results in tests for deoxyribonuclease production, nitrate reduction to nitrite, and growth in the presence of 1, 3.5, and 6 percent NaCl (weight by volume, in nutrient broth).</s><s>Tests that produced negative results include hydrogen sulfide production on triple-sugar iron agar; phenylalanine deaminase, utilization of malonate or acetate- gelatin hydrolysis; growth in the presence of potassium cyanide; lipase (corn oil) production; the O-nitro-phenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside test; the string test; fermentation of D-adonitol L-arabinose, D-arabitol, cellobiose, dulcitol, erythritol, i-inositol, lactose, D-mannitol, melibiose, α-methyl-D- glucoside, mucate, raffinose, L-rhamnose, salicin, D-sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and D-xylose; and growth in the presence of 0, 8, 10, and 12 percent sodium chloride (weight by volume, in nutrient broth).</s></p></content></protolog>
