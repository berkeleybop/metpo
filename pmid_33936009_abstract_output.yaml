  Plants live in association with microorganisms that positively influence plant 
  development, vigor, and fitness in response to pathogens and abiotic stressors. 
  The bulk of the plant microbiome is concentrated belowground at the plant 
  root-soil interface. Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing 
  primary and secondary low molecular weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. 
  These exudates provide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their 
  affinity to host plants, but molecular details of this process are largely 
  unresolved. We addressed this gap by focusing on the molecular dialog between 
  eight well-characterized beneficial strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens group 
  and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for economically important food, feed, 
  forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We collected and analyzed root 
  exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence of multiple 
  carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds. The 
  subsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that 
  many of these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. 
  RNA-seq profiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed 
  changes in the expression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic 
  enzymes, transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress response, and 
  conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost half of the differentially expressed 
  genes mapped to the variable part of the strains' pangenome, reflecting the 
  importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of P. fluorescens to 
  the rhizosphere lifestyle. Our results collectively reveal the diversity of 
  cellular pathways and physiological responses underlying the establishment of 
  mutualistic interactions between these beneficial rhizobacteria and their plant 
  hosts.
