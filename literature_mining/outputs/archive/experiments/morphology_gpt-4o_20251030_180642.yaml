  Title: Methyloradius Palustris Gen. Nov., Sp. Nov., a Methanol-oxidizing Bacterium Isolated From Snow

  Authors: Miyadera T, Kojima H, Fukui M.

  Journal:  (2021)

  DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-687530/v1

  Abstract:
  <title>Abstract</title>  <p>A novel methylotrophic bacterium, strain Zm11 T , was isolated from reddish brown snow collected in a moor in Japan. Cells of the isolate were Gram-stain-negative, motile and rod-shaped (0.6-0.7×1.2-2.7 μm). Growth was observed at 5–32°C with an optimum growth temperature of 25–28°C. The pH range for growth was 5.4–7.8 with an optimum pH of 6.8. The strain utilized only methanol as carbon and energy sources for aerobic growth. The major cellular fatty acids (>40% of total) were summed feature 3 (C 16:1 ω 7 c and/or C 16:1 ω 6 c ) and C 16 : 0 . The predominant quinone was Q-8. The complete genome of strain Zm11 T is composed of a circular chromosome (2,800,413 bp), with G + C content of 46.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence and conserved proteins encoded in the genome. The results of analyses indicate that strain Zm11 T is a member of the family Methylophilaceae but does not belong to any existing genus. On the basis of its genomic and phenotypic properties, strain Zm11 T (= DSM111909 T = NBRC114766 T ) is proposed as the type strain of a new species in a new genus, Methyloradius palustris gen. nov., sp. nov.</p>

  Title: Current Trends in Methylotrophy.

  Authors: Chistoserdova L, Kalyuzhnaya MG.

  Journal:  (2018)

  DOI: 10.1016/j.tim.2018.01.011
  PMID: 29471983

  Abstract:
  Methylotrophy is a field of study dealing with microorganisms capable of utilization of compounds devoid of carbon-carbon bonds (C1 compounds). In this review, we highlight several emerging trends in methylotrophy. First, we discuss the significance of the recent discovery of lanthanide-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases for understanding both the occurrence and the distribution of methylotrophy functions among bacteria, and then we discuss the newly appreciated role of lanthanides in biology. Next, we describe the detection of other methylotrophy pathways across novel bacterial taxa and insights into the evolution of methylotrophy. Further, data are presented on the occurrence and activity of aerobic methylotrophs in hypoxic and anoxic environments, questioning the prior assumptions on niche separation of aerobic and anaerobic methylotrophy. The concept of communal function in aerobic methane oxidation is also briefly discussed. Finally, we review recent research in engineering methylotrophs for biotechnological applications as well as recent progress in engineering synthetic methylotrophy.

  Title: Mechanism of Pyrroloquinoline Quinone-Dependent Hydride Transfer Chemistry from Spectroscopic and High-Resolution X-ray Structural Studies of the Methanol Dehydrogenase from <i>Methylococcus capsulatus</i> (Bath).

  Authors: Chan SI, Chuankhayan P, Reddy Nareddy PK, Tsai IK, Tsai YF, Chen KH, Yu SS, Chen CJ.

  Journal:  (2021)

  DOI: 10.1021/jacs.0c11414
  PMID: 33629832

  Abstract:
  The active site of methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) contains a rare disulfide bridge between adjacent cysteine residues. As a vicinal disulfide, the structure is highly strained, suggesting it might work together with the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) prosthetic group and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion in the catalytic turnover during methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) oxidation. We purify MDH from <i>Methylococcus capsulatus</i> (Bath) with the disulfide bridge broken into two thiols. Spectroscopic and high-resolution X-ray crystallographic studies of this form of MDH indicate that the disulfide bridge is redox active. We observe an internal redox process within the <i>holo</i>-MDH that produces a disulfide radical anion concomitant with a companion PQQ radical, as evidenced by an optical absorption at 408 nm and a magnetically dipolar-coupled biradical in the EPR spectrum. These observations are corroborated by electron-density changes between the two cysteine sulfurs of the disulfide bridge as well as between the bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion and the O5-C5 bond of the PQQ in the high-resolution X-ray structure. On the basis of these findings, we propose a mechanism for the controlled redistribution of the two electrons during hydride transfer from the CH<sub>3</sub>OH in the alcohol oxidation without formation of the reduced PQQ ethenediol, a biradical mechanism that allows for possible recovery of the hydride for transfer to an external NAD<sup>+</sup> oxidant in the regeneration of the PQQ cofactor for multiple catalytic turnovers. In support of this mechanism, a steady-state level of the disulfide radical anion is observed during turnover of the MDH in the presence of CH<sub>3</sub>OH and NAD<sup>+</sup>.

  Abstract:
  The draft genome of Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, a thermoacidophilic methanotroph of the phylum Verrucomicrobia, is presented. Annotation revealed pathways for one-carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen catabolism and respiration together with central metabolic pathways. The genome encodes three orthologues of particulate methane monooxygenases. Sequencing of this genome will help in the understanding of methane cycling in volcanic environments.

  Abstract:
  Methanotrophs are ubiquitous bacteria that can use the greenhouse gas methane as a sole carbon and energy source for growth, thus playing major roles in global carbon cycles, and in particular, substantially reducing emissions of biologically generated methane to the atmosphere. Despite their importance, and in contrast to organisms that play roles in other major parts of the carbon cycle such as photosynthesis, no genome-level studies have been published on the biology of methanotrophs. We report the first complete genome sequence to our knowledge from an obligate methanotroph, Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), obtained by the shotgun sequencing approach. Analysis revealed a 3.3-Mb genome highly specialized for a methanotrophic lifestyle, including redundant pathways predicted to be involved in methanotrophy and duplicated genes for essential enzymes such as the methane monooxygenases. We used phylogenomic analysis, gene order information, and comparative analysis with the partially sequenced methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens to detect genes of unknown function likely to be involved in methanotrophy and methylotrophy. Genome analysis suggests the ability of M. capsulatus to scavenge copper (including a previously unreported nonribosomal peptide synthetase) and to use copper in regulation of methanotrophy, but the exact regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. One of the most surprising outcomes of the project is evidence suggesting the existence of previously unsuspected metabolic flexibility in M. capsulatus, including an ability to grow on sugars, oxidize chemolithotrophic hydrogen and sulfur, and live under reduced oxygen tension, all of which have implications for methanotroph ecology. The availability of the complete genome of M. capsulatus (Bath) deepens our understanding of methanotroph biology and its relationship to global carbon cycles. We have gained evidence for greater metabolic flexibility than was previously known, and for genetic components that may have biotechnological potential.

  Title: Selective and Efficient Biomacromolecular Extraction of Rare-Earth Elements using Lanmodulin.

  Authors: Deblonde GJ, Mattocks JA, Park DM, Reed DW, Cotruvo JA, Jiao Y.

  Journal:  (2020)

  DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c01303
  PMID: 32686425

  Abstract:
  Lanmodulin (LanM) is a recently discovered protein that undergoes a large conformational change in response to rare-earth elements (REEs). Here, we use multiple physicochemical methods to demonstrate that LanM is the most selective macromolecule for REEs characterized to date and even outperforms many synthetic chelators. Moreover, LanM exhibits metal-binding properties and structural stability unseen in most other metalloproteins. LanM retains REE binding down to pH ≈ 2.5, and LanM-REE complexes withstand high temperature (up to 95 °C), repeated acid treatments, and up to molar amounts of competing non-REE metal ions (including Mg, Ca, Zn, and Cu), allowing the protein's use in harsh chemical processes. LanM's unrivaled properties were applied to metal extraction from two distinct REE-containing industrial feedstocks covering a broad range of REE and non-REE concentrations, namely, precombustion coal and electronic waste leachates. After only a single all-aqueous step, quantitative and selective recovery of the REEs from all non-REEs initially present (Li, Na, Mg, Ca, Sr, Al, Si, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and U) was achieved, demonstrating the universal selectivity of LanM for REEs against non-REEs and its potential application even for industrial low-grade sources, which are currently underutilized. Our work indicates that biosourced macromolecules such as LanM may offer a new paradigm for extractive metallurgy and other applications involving f-elements.

  {'content': 'Methylovirgula ligni gen. nov., sp. nov., an obligately acidophilic, facultatively methylotrophic bacterium with a highly divergent mxaF gene.\n\nTwo strains of Gram-negative, aerobic, non-pigmented, non-motile, rod-shaped bacteria were isolated from beechwood blocks during decay by the white-rot fungus Hypholoma fasciculare and were designated strains BW863(T) and BW872. They are capable of methylotrophic growth and assimilate carbon via the ribulose-bisphosphate pathway. In addition to methanol, the novel isolates utilized ethanol, pyruvate and malate. Strains BW863(T) and BW872 are obligately acidophilic, mesophilic organisms capable of growth at pH 3.1-6.5 (with an optimum at pH 4.5-5.0) and at 4-30 degrees C. Phospholipid fatty acid profiles of these bacteria contain unusually large amounts (about 90 %) of C(18 : 1)omega7c, thereby resembling the profiles of Methylobacterium strains. The predominant quinone is Q-10. The DNA G+C content of the novel isolates is 61.8-62.8 mol%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strains BW863(T) and BW872 are most closely related to the acidophilic methanotroph Methylocapsa acidiphila B2(T) (96.5-97 %). Comparative sequence analysis of mxaF, the gene encoding the large subunit of methanol dehydrogenase, placed the MxaF sequences of the two novel strains in a cluster that is distinct from all previously described MxaF sequences of cultivated methylotrophs. The identity between the MxaF sequences of the acidophilic isolates and those from known alpha-, beta- and gammaproteobacterial methylotrophs was respectively 69-75, 61-63 and 64-67 %. The data therefore suggest that strains BW863(T) and BW872 represent a novel genus and species of methylotrophic bacteria, for which the name Methylovirgula ligni gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. Strain BW863(T) (=DSM 19998(T) =NCIMB 14408(T)) is the type strain of Methylovirgula ligni.\n\nPMID:19622650', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

  Abstract:
  Several of the metabolic enzymes in methanotrophic bacteria rely on metals for both their expression and their catalysis. The MxaFI methanol dehydrogenase enzyme complex uses calcium as a cofactor to oxidize methanol, while the alternative methanol dehydrogenase XoxF uses lanthanide metals such as lanthanum and cerium for the same function. Lanthanide metals, abundant in the earth's crust, strongly repress the transcription of <i>mxaF</i> yet activate the transcription of <i>xoxF</i> This regulatory program, called the "lanthanide switch," is central to methylotrophic metabolism, but only some of its components are known. To uncover additional components of the lanthanide switch, we developed a chemical mutagenesis system in the type I gammaproteobacterial methanotroph "<i>Methylotuvimicrobium buryatense</i>" 5GB1C and designed a selection system for mutants unable to repress the <i>mxaF</i> promoter in the presence of lanthanum. Whole-genome resequencing for multiple lanthanide switch mutants identified several unique point mutations in a single gene encoding a TonB-dependent receptor, which we have named LanA. The LanA TonB-dependent receptor is absolutely required for the lanthanide switch and controls the expression of a small set of genes. While mutation of the <i>lanA</i> gene does not affect the amount of cell-associated lanthanum, it is essential for growth in the absence of the MxaF methanol dehydrogenase, suggesting that LanA is involved in lanthanum uptake to supply the XoxF methanol dehydrogenase with its critical metal ion cofactor. The discovery of this novel component of the lanthanide regulatory system highlights the complexity of this circuit and suggests that further components are likely involved.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Lanthanide metals, or rare earth elements, are abundant in nature and used heavily in technological devices. Biological interactions with lanthanides are just beginning to be unraveled. Until very recently, microbial mechanisms of lanthanide metal interaction and uptake were unknown. The TonB-dependent receptor LanA is the first lanthanum receptor identified in a methanotroph. Sequence homology searches with known metal transporters and regulators could not be used to identify LanA or other lanthanide metal switch components, and this method for mutagenesis and selection was required to identify the receptor. This work advances the knowledge of microbe-metal interactions in environmental niches that impact atmospheric methane levels and are thus relevant to climate change.

Based on the results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain 7MK25T showed the highest similarity (93.6 %) to Methyloferula stellata AR4T, followed by Bosea thiooxidans DSM 9653T (93.3 %). Strain 6Y81T had the highest similarity of 97.9 % to Lichenibacterium minor RmlP026T, followed by Lichenibacterium ramalinae RmlP001T (97.2 %). Phylogenomic analysis using the UBCG and PhyloPhlAn methods consistently showed that strain 7MK25T formed a sister clade to Boseaceae, while strain 6Y81T formed an independent clade within the genus Lichenibacterium, both in the order Hyphomicrobiales. The digital DNA-DNA hybridization and average nucleotide identity values between strains 7MK25T, 6Y81T and their close relatives were in the ranges of 19.1-29.9 % and 72.5-85.5 %, respectively. The major fatty acids of 7MK25T were summed feature 8 (C18 : 1 ω7c/C18 : 1 ω6c), C19 : 0 cyclo ω8c, C16 : 0 and C17 : 0 cyclo, while those of 6Y81T were summed feature 8 (C18 : 1 ω7c/C18 : 1 ω6c), C16 : 0 and C16 : 0 3-OH. Strains 7MK25T and 6Y81T took diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine as their dominant polar lipids, and Q-10 as their major respiratory quinone. On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic data, strain 7MK25T is proposed to represent a novel species of a novel genus with name Terrirubrum flagellatum gen. nov., sp. nov., within a novel family Terrirubraceae fam. nov., with 7MK25T (=KCTC 62738T=GDMCC 1.1452T) as its type strain.

  Abstract:
  Rhizobia described so far belong to three distinct phylogenetic branches within the alpha-2 subclass of Proteobacteria. Here we report the discovery of a fourth rhizobial branch involving bacteria of the Methylobacterium genus. Rhizobia isolated from Crotalaria legumes were assigned to a new species, "Methylobacterium nodulans," within the Methylobacterium genus on the basis of 16S ribosomal DNA analyses. We demonstrated that these rhizobia facultatively grow on methanol, which is a characteristic of Methylobacterium spp. but a unique feature among rhizobia. Genes encoding two key enzymes of methylotrophy and nodulation, the mxaF gene, encoding the alpha subunit of the methanol dehydrogenase, and the nodA gene, encoding an acyltransferase involved in Nod factor biosynthesis, were sequenced for the type strain, ORS2060. Plant tests and nodA amplification assays showed that "M. nodulans" is the only nodulating Methylobacterium sp. identified so far. Phylogenetic sequence analysis showed that "M. nodulans" NodA is closely related to Bradyrhizobium NodA, suggesting that this gene was acquired by horizontal gene transfer.

  Title: Assessing Lanthanide-Dependent Methanol Dehydrogenase Activity: The Assay Matters.

  Authors: Phi MT, Singer H, Zäh F, Haisch C, Schneider S, Op den Camp HJM, Daumann LJ.

  Journal:  (2024)

  DOI: 10.1002/cbic.202300811
  PMID: 38269599

  Abstract:
  Artificial dye-coupled assays have been widely adopted as a rapid and convenient method to assess the activity of methanol dehydrogenases (MDH). Lanthanide(Ln)-dependent XoxF-MDHs are able to incorporate different lanthanides (Lns) in their active site. Dye-coupled assays showed that the earlier Lns exhibit a higher enzyme activity than the late Lns. Despite widespread use, there are limitations: oftentimes a pH of 9 and activators are required for the assay. Moreover, Ln-MDH variants are not obtained by isolation from the cells grown with the respective Ln, but by incubation of an apo-MDH with the Ln. Herein, we report the cultivation of Ln-dependent methanotroph Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV with nine different Lns, the isolation of the respective MDHs and the assessment of the enzyme activity using the dye-coupled assay. We compare these results with a protein-coupled assay using its physiological electron acceptor cytochrome c<sub>GJ</sub> (cyt c<sub>GJ</sub> ). Depending on the assay, two distinct trends are observed among the Ln series. The specific enzyme activity of La-, Ce- and Pr-MDH, as measured by the protein-coupled assay, exceeds that measured by the dye-coupled assay. This suggests that early Lns also have a positive effect on the interaction between XoxF-MDH and its cyt c<sub>GJ</sub> thereby increasing functional efficiency.

  Title: Rare earths stick to rare cyanobacteria: Future potential for bioremediation and recovery of rare earth elements.

  Authors: Paper M, Koch M, Jung P, Lakatos M, Nilges T, Brück TB.

  Journal:  (2023)

  DOI: 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1130939
  PMID: 36926689
  PMCID: PMC10011134

  Abstract:
  Biosorption of metal ions by phototrophic microorganisms is regarded as a sustainable and alternative method for bioremediation and metal recovery. In this study, 12 cyanobacterial strains, including 7 terrestrial and 5 aquatic cyanobacteria, covering a broad phylogenetic diversity were investigated for their potential application in the enrichment of rare earth elements through biosorption. A screening for the maximum adsorption capacity of cerium, neodymium, terbium, and lanthanum was conducted in which <i>Nostoc</i> sp. 20.02 showed the highest adsorption capacity with 84.2-91.5 mg g<sup>-1</sup>. Additionally, <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973, <i>Calothrix brevissima</i> SAG 34.79, <i>Desmonostoc muscorum</i> 90.03, and <i>Komarekiella</i> sp. 89.12 were promising candidate strains, with maximum adsorption capacities of 69.5-83.4 mg g<sup>-1</sup>, 68.6-83.5 mg g<sup>-1</sup>, 44.7-70.6 mg g<sup>-1</sup>, and 47.2-67.1 mg g<sup>-1</sup> respectively. Experiments with cerium on adsorption properties of the five highest metal adsorbing strains displayed fast adsorption kinetics and a strong influence of the pH value on metal uptake, with an optimum at pH 5 to 6. Studies on binding specificity with mixed-metal solutions strongly indicated an ion-exchange mechanism in which Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are replaced by other metal cations during the biosorption process. Depending on the cyanobacterial strain, FT-IR analysis indicated the involvement different functional groups like hydroxyl and carboxyl groups during the adsorption process. Overall, the application of cyanobacteria as biosorbent in bioremediation and recovery of rare earth elements is a promising method for the development of an industrial process and has to be further optimized and adjusted regarding metal-containing wastewater and adsorption efficiency by cyanobacterial biomass.

  Title: Compartment-related aspects of XoxF protein functionality in Methylorubrum extorquens DM4 analysed using its cytoplasmic targeting.

  Authors: Firsova YE, Mustakhimov II, Torgonskaya ML.

  Journal:  (2023)

  DOI: 10.1007/s10482-023-01811-6
  PMID: 36719530

  Abstract:
  The impact of periplasmic localisation on the functioning of the XoxF protein was evaluated in the well-studied dichloromethane-utilising methylotroph Methylorubrum extorquens DM4, which harbors only one paralogue of the xoxF gene. It was found that the cytoplasmic targeting of XoxF by expression of the corresponding gene without the sequence encoding the N-terminal signal peptide does not impair the activation and lanthanide-dependent regulation of the MxaFI-methanol dehydrogenase genes. Analysis of the viability of ΔxoxF cells complemented with the full-length and truncated xoxF gene also showed that the expression of cytoplasmically targeted XoxF even increases the resistance to acids. These results contradict the proposed function of the XoxF protein as an extracytoplasmic signal sensor. At the same time, the observed dynamics of growth with methanol, as well as with dichloromethane of strains expressing cytoplasmic-targeted XoxF, indicate the probable enzymatic activity of lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase in this compartment. Herewith, the only available substrate for this enzyme in cells growing with dichloromethane was formaldehyde, which is produced during the primary metabolism of the mentioned halogenated toxicant directly in the cytosol. These findings suggest that the maturation of XoxF-methanol dehydrogenase may occur already in the cytoplasm, while the factors changing affinity of this enzyme for formaldehyde are apparently absent there. Together with the demonstrated functioning of an enhancer-like upstream activating sequence in the promoter region of the xoxF gene in M. extorquens DM4, the obtained information enriches our understanding of the regulation, synthesis and role of the XoxF protein.

  Title: Multiple Rounds of <i>In Vivo</i> Random Mutagenesis and Selection in <i>Vibrio natriegens</i> Result in Substantial Increases in REE Binding Capacity.

  Abstract:
  Rare earth elements (REE) are essential ingredients in many modern technologies, yet their purification remains either environmentally harmful or economically unviable. Adsorption, or biosorption, of REE onto bacterial cell membranes offers a sustainable alternative to traditional solvent extraction methods. But in order for biosorption-based REE purification to compete economically, the capacity and specificity of biosorption sites must be enhanced. Although there have been some recent advances in characterizing the genetics of REE-biosorption, the variety and complexity of bacterial membrane surface sites make targeted genetic engineering difficult. Here, we propose using multiple rounds of <i>in vivo</i> random mutagenesis induced by the MP6 plasmid combined with plate-throughput REE-biosorption screening to improve a microbe's capacity and selectivity for biosorbing REE. We engineered a strain of <i>Vibrio natriegens</i> capable of biosorbing 210% more dysprosium compared to the wild-type and produced selectivity improvements of up to 50% between the lightest (lanthanum) and heaviest (lutetium) REE. We believe that mutations we observed in ABC transporters as well as a nonessential protein in the BAM outer membrane β-barrel protein insertion complex likely contribute to some─but almost certainly not all─of the biosorption changes we observed. Given the ease of finding significant biosorption mutants, these results highlight just how many genes likely contribute to biosorption as well as the power of random mutagenesis in identifying genes of interest and optimizing a biological system for a task.

  Title: Isolation, sequencing, and mutagenesis of the gene encoding cytochrome c553i of Paracoccus denitrificans and characterization of the mutant strain.

  Authors: Ras J, Reijnders WN, Van Spanning RJ, Harms N, Oltmann LF, Stouthamer AH.

  Journal:  (1991)

  PMID: 1657873
  PMCID: PMC209051

  Abstract:
  The periplasmically located cytochrome c553i of Paracoccus denitrificans was purified from cells grown aerobically on choline as the carbon source. The purified protein was digested with trypsin to obtain several protein fragments. The N-terminal regions of these fragments were sequenced. On the basis of one of these sequences, a mix of 17-mer oligonucleotides was synthesized. By using this mix as a probe, the structural gene encoding cytochrome c553i (cycB) was isolated. The nucleotide sequence of this gene was determined from a genomic bank. The N-terminal region of the deduced amino acid sequence showed characteristics of a signal sequence. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature protein, the calculated molecular weight is 22,427. The gene encoding cytochrome c553i was mutated by insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene. As a consequence of the mutation, cytochrome c553i was absent from the periplasmic protein fraction. The mutation in cycB resulted in a decreased maximum specific growth rate on methanol, while the molecular growth yield was not affected. Growth on methylamine or succinate was not affected at all. Upstream of cycB the 3' part of an open reading frame (ORF1) was identified. The deduced amino acid sequence of this part of ORF1 showed homology with methanol dehydrogenases from P. denitrificans and Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. In addition, it showed homology with other quinoproteins like alcohol dehydrogenase from Acetobacter aceti and glucose dehydrogenase from both Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Escherichia coli. Immediately downstream from cycB, the 5' part of another open reading frame (ORF2) was found. The deduced amino acid sequence of this part of ORF2 showed homology with the moxJ gene products from P. denitrificans and M. extorquens AM1.

  Title: Lanthanide-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases require an essential aspartate residue for metal coordination and enzymatic function.

  Authors: Good NM, Fellner M, Demirer K, Hu J, Hausinger RP, Martinez-Gomez NC.

  Journal:  (2020)

  DOI: 10.1074/jbc.ra120.013227
  PMID: 32366463
  PMCID: PMC7294098

  Abstract:
  The lanthanide elements (Ln<sup>3+</sup>), those with atomic numbers 57-63 (excluding promethium, Pm<sup>3+</sup>), form a cofactor complex with pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) in bacterial XoxF methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs) and ExaF ethanol dehydrogenases (EDHs), expanding the range of biological elements and opening novel areas of metabolism and ecology. Other MDHs, known as MxaFIs, are related in sequence and structure to these proteins, yet they instead possess a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-PQQ cofactor. An important missing piece of the Ln<sup>3+</sup> puzzle is defining what features distinguish enzymes that use Ln<sup>3+</sup>-PQQ cofactors from those that do not. Here, using XoxF1 MDH from the model methylotrophic bacterium <i>Methylorubrum extorquens</i> AM1, we investigated the functional importance of a proposed lanthanide-coordinating aspartate residue. We report two crystal structures of XoxF1, one with and another without PQQ, both with La<sup>3+</sup> bound in the active-site region and coordinated by Asp<sup>320</sup> Using constructs to produce either recombinant XoxF1 or its D320A variant, we show that Asp<sup>320</sup> is needed for <i>in vivo</i> catalytic function, <i>in vitro</i> activity, and La<sup>3+</sup> coordination. XoxF1 and XoxF1 D320A, when produced in the absence of La<sup>3+</sup>, coordinated Ca<sup>2+</sup> but exhibited little or no catalytic activity. We also generated the parallel substitution in ExaF to produce ExaF D319S and found that this variant loses the capacity for efficient ethanol oxidation with La<sup>3+</sup> These results provide evidence that a Ln<sup>3+</sup>-coordinating aspartate is essential for the enzymatic functions of XoxF MDHs and ExaF EDHs, supporting the notion that sequences of these enzymes, and the genes that encode them, are markers for Ln<sup>3+</sup> metabolism.

  Title: Structural Basis for Rare Earth Element Recognition by Methylobacterium extorquens Lanmodulin.

  Authors: Cook EC, Featherston ER, Showalter SA, Cotruvo JA.

  Journal:  (2019)

  DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b01019
  PMID: 30352145

  Abstract:
  Lanmodulin (LanM) is a high-affinity lanthanide (Ln)-binding protein recently identified in Methylobacterium extorquens, a bacterium that requires Lns for the function of at least two enzymes. LanM possesses four EF-hands, metal coordination motifs generally associated with Ca<sup>II</sup> binding, but it undergoes a metal-dependent conformational change with a 100 million-fold selectivity for Ln<sup>III</sup>s and Y<sup>III</sup> over Ca<sup>II</sup>. Here we present the nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of LanM complexed with Y<sup>III</sup>. This structure reveals that LanM features an unusual fusion of adjacent EF-hands, resulting in a compact fold to the best of our knowledge unique among EF-hand-containing proteins. It also supports the importance of an additional carboxylate ligand in contributing to the protein's picomolar affinity for Ln<sup>III</sup>s, and it suggests a role of unusual N <sub>i+1</sub>-H···N <sub>i</sub> hydrogen bonds, in which LanM's unique EF-hand proline residues are engaged, in selective Ln<sup>III</sup> recognition. This work sets the stage for a detailed mechanistic understanding of LanM's Ln selectivity, which may inspire new strategies for binding, detecting, and sequestering these technologically important metals.

  Title: XoxF Acts as the Predominant Methanol Dehydrogenase in the Type I Methanotroph Methylomicrobium buryatense.

  Authors: Chu F, Lidstrom ME.

  Journal:  (2016)

  DOI: 10.1128/jb.00959-15
  PMID: 26858104
  PMCID: PMC4859581

  Abstract:
  <h4>Unlabelled</h4>Many methylotrophic taxa harbor two distinct methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) systems for oxidizing methanol to formaldehyde: the well-studied calcium-dependent MxaFI type and the more recently discovered lanthanide-containing XoxF type. MxaFI has traditionally been accepted as the major functional MDH in bacteria that contain both enzymes. However, in this study, we present evidence that, in a type I methanotroph, Methylomicrobium buryatense, XoxF is likely the primary functional MDH in the environment. The addition of lanthanides increases xoxF expression and greatly reduces mxa expression, even under conditions in which calcium concentrations are almost 100-fold higher than lanthanide concentrations. Mutations in genes encoding the MDH enzymes validate our finding that XoxF is the major functional MDH, as XoxF mutants grow more poorly than MxaFI mutants under unfavorable culturing conditions. In addition, mutant and transcriptional analyses demonstrate that the lanthanide-dependent MDH switch operating in methanotrophs is mediated in part by the orphan response regulator MxaB, whose gene transcription is itself lanthanide responsive.<h4>Importance</h4>Aerobic methanotrophs, bacteria that oxidize methane for carbon and energy, require a methanol dehydrogenase enzyme to convert methanol into formaldehyde. The calcium-dependent enzyme MxaFI has been thought to primarily carry out methanol oxidation in methanotrophs. Recently, it was discovered that XoxF, a lanthanide-containing enzyme present in most methanotrophs, can also oxidize methanol. In a methanotroph with both MxaFI and XoxF, we demonstrate that lanthanides transcriptionally control genes encoding the two methanol dehydrogenases, in part by controlling expression of the response regulator MxaB. Lanthanides are abundant in the Earth's crust, and we demonstrate that micromolar amounts of lanthanides are sufficient to suppress MxaFI expression. Thus, we present evidence that XoxF acts as the predominant methanol dehydrogenase in a methanotroph.

  Abstract:
  <h4>Background</h4>Methylotrophy describes the ability of organisms to grow on reduced organic compounds without carbon-carbon bonds. The genomes of two pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophic bacteria of the Alpha-proteobacterial genus Methylobacterium, the reference species Methylobacterium extorquens strain AM1 and the dichloromethane-degrading strain DM4, were compared.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>The 6.88 Mb genome of strain AM1 comprises a 5.51 Mb chromosome, a 1.26 Mb megaplasmid and three plasmids, while the 6.12 Mb genome of strain DM4 features a 5.94 Mb chromosome and two plasmids. The chromosomes are highly syntenic and share a large majority of genes, while plasmids are mostly strain-specific, with the exception of a 130 kb region of the strain AM1 megaplasmid which is syntenic to a chromosomal region of strain DM4. Both genomes contain large sets of insertion elements, many of them strain-specific, suggesting an important potential for genomic plasticity. Most of the genomic determinants associated with methylotrophy are nearly identical, with two exceptions that illustrate the metabolic and genomic versatility of Methylobacterium. A 126 kb dichloromethane utilization (dcm) gene cluster is essential for the ability of strain DM4 to use DCM as the sole carbon and energy source for growth and is unique to strain DM4. The methylamine utilization (mau) gene cluster is only found in strain AM1, indicating that strain DM4 employs an alternative system for growth with methylamine. The dcm and mau clusters represent two of the chromosomal genomic islands (AM1: 28; DM4: 17) that were defined. The mau cluster is flanked by mobile elements, but the dcm cluster disrupts a gene annotated as chelatase and for which we propose the name "island integration determinant" (iid).<h4>Conclusion/significance</h4>These two genome sequences provide a platform for intra- and interspecies genomic comparisons in the genus Methylobacterium, and for investigations of the adaptive mechanisms which allow bacterial lineages to acquire methylotrophic lifestyles.

  Title: Metabolism-linked methylotaxis sensors responsible for plant colonization in Methylobacterium aquaticum strain 22A.

  Authors: [From original CMM/PFAS dataset]

  Journal: [See PMID for details]

  PMID: 37901831

  Abstract:
  Motile bacteria take a competitive advantage in colonization of plant surfaces to establish beneficial associations that eventually support plant health. Plant exudates serve not only as primary growth substrates for bacteria but also as bacterial chemotaxis attractants. A number of plant-derived compounds and corresponding chemotaxis sensors have been documented, however, the sensors for methanol, one of the major volatile compounds released by plants, have not been identified. Methylobacterium species are ubiquitous plant surface-symbiotic, methylotrophic bacteria. A plant-growth promoting bacterium, M. aquaticum strain 22A exhibits chemotaxis toward methanol (methylotaxis). Its genome encodes 52 methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), among which we identified three MCPs (methylotaxis proteins, MtpA, MtpB, and MtpC) responsible for methylotaxis. The triple gene mutant of the MCPs exhibited no methylotaxis, slower gathering to plant tissues, and less efficient colonization on plants than the wild type, suggesting that the methylotaxis mediates initiation of plant-Methylobacterium symbiosis and engages in proliferation on plants. To examine how these MCPs are operating methylotaxis, we generated multiple gene knockouts of the MCPs, and Ca2+-dependent MxaFI and lanthanide (Ln3+)-dependent XoxF methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs), whose expression is regulated by the presence of Ln3+. MtpA was found to be a cytosolic sensor that conducts formaldehyde taxis (formtaxis), as well as methylotaxis when MDHs generate formaldehyde. MtpB contained a dCache domain and exhibited differential cellular localization in response to La3+. MtpB expression was induced by La3+, and its activity required XoxF1. MtpC exhibited typical cell pole localization, required MxaFI activity, and was regulated under MxbDM that is also required for MxaF expression. Strain 22A methylotaxis is realized by three independent MCPs, two of which monitor methanol oxidation by Ln3+-regulated MDHs, and one of which monitors the common methanol oxidation product, formaldehyde. We propose that methanol metabolism-linked chemotaxis is the key factor for the efficient colonization of Methylobacterium on plants.

  Title: Stress resistance and C1 metabolism involved in plant colonization of a methanotroph Methylosinus sp. B4S.

  Authors: Iguchi H, Sato I, Yurimoto H, Sakai Y.

  Journal:  (2013)

  DOI: 10.1007/s00203-013-0922-6
  PMID: 24037422

  Abstract:
  Methanotrophs are widespread and have been isolated from various environments including the phyllosphere. In this study, we characterized the plant colonization by Methylosinus sp. B4S, an α-proteobacterial methanotroph isolated from plant leaf. The gfp-tagged Methylosinus sp. B4S cells were observed to colonize Arabidopsis leaf surfaces by forming aggregates. We cloned and sequenced the general stress response genes, phyR, nepR and ecfG, from Methylosinus sp. B4S. In vitro analysis showed that the phyR expression level was increased after heat shock challenge, and phyR was shown to be involved in resistance to heat shock and UV light. In the phyllospheric condition, the gene expression level of phyR as well as mmoX and mxaF was found to be relatively high, compared with methane-grown liquid cultures. The phyR-deletion strain as well as the wild-type strain inoculated on Arabidopsis leaves proliferated at the initial phase and then gradually decreased during plant colonization. These results have shed light firstly on the importance of general stress resistance and C1 metabolism in methanotroph living in the phyllosphere.

  Title: Enhanced rare-earth separation with a metal-sensitive lanmodulin dimer.

  Authors: Mattocks JA, Jung JJ, Lin CY, Dong Z, Yennawar NH, Featherston ER, Kang-Yun CS, Hamilton TA, Park DM, Boal AK, Cotruvo JA.

  Abstract:
  Technologically critical rare-earth elements are notoriously difficult to separate, owing to their subtle differences in ionic radius and coordination number<sup>1-3</sup>. The natural lanthanide-binding protein lanmodulin (LanM)<sup>4,5</sup> is a sustainable alternative to conventional solvent-extraction-based separation<sup>6</sup>. Here we characterize a new LanM, from Hansschlegelia quercus (Hans-LanM), with an oligomeric state sensitive to rare-earth ionic radius, the lanthanum(III)-induced dimer being >100-fold tighter than the dysprosium(III)-induced dimer. X-ray crystal structures illustrate how picometre-scale differences in radius between lanthanum(III) and dysprosium(III) are propagated to Hans-LanM's quaternary structure through a carboxylate shift that rearranges a second-sphere hydrogen-bonding network. Comparison to the prototypal LanM from Methylorubrum extorquens reveals distinct metal coordination strategies, rationalizing Hans-LanM's greater selectivity within the rare-earth elements. Finally, structure-guided mutagenesis of a key residue at the Hans-LanM dimer interface modulates dimerization in solution and enables single-stage, column-based separation of a neodymium(III)/dysprosium(III) mixture to >98% individual element purities. This work showcases the natural diversity of selective lanthanide recognition motifs, and it reveals rare-earth-sensitive dimerization as a biological principle by which to tune the performance of biomolecule-based separation processes.

  Title: Structure and function of the lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase XoxF from the methanotroph Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1C.

  Authors: Deng YW, Ro SY, Rosenzweig AC.

  Journal:  (2018)

  DOI: 10.1007/s00775-018-1604-2
  PMID: 30132076
  PMCID: PMC6370294

  Abstract:
  In methylotrophic bacteria, which use one-carbon (C1) compounds as a carbon source, methanol is oxidized by pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) enzymes. Methylotrophic genomes generally encode two distinct MDHs, MxaF and XoxF. MxaF is a well-studied, calcium-dependent heterotetrameric enzyme whereas XoxF is a lanthanide-dependent homodimer. Recent studies suggest that XoxFs are likely the functional MDHs in many environments. In methanotrophs, methylotrophs that utilize methane, interactions between particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) and MxaF have been detected. To investigate the possibility of interactions between pMMO and XoxF, XoxF was isolated from the methanotroph Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1C (5G-XoxF). Purified 5G-XoxF exhibits a specific activity of 0.16 μmol DCPIP reduced min<sup>-1</sup> mg<sup>-1</sup>. The 1.85 Å resolution crystal structure reveals a La(III) ion in the active site, in contrast to the calcium ion in MxaF. The overall fold is similar to other MDH structures, but 5G-XoxF is a monomer in solution. An interaction between 5G-XoxF and its cognate pMMO was detected by biolayer interferometry, with a K<sub>D</sub> value of 50 ± 17 μM. These results suggest an alternative model of MDH-pMMO association, in which a XoxF monomer may bind to pMMO, and underscore the potential importance of lanthanide-dependent MDHs in biological methane oxidation.

  Title: Rare earth metals are essential for methanotrophic life in volcanic mudpots.

  Authors: Pol A, Barends TR, Dietl A, Khadem AF, Eygensteyn J, Jetten MS, Op den Camp HJ.

  Journal:  (2014)

  DOI: 10.1111/1462-2920.12249
  PMID: 24034209

  Abstract:
  Growth of Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, an extremely acidophilic methanotrophic microbe isolated from an Italian volcanic mudpot, is shown to be strictly dependent on the presence of lanthanides, a group of rare earth elements (REEs) such as lanthanum (Ln), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr) and neodymium (Nd). After fractionation of the bacterial cells and crystallization of the methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), it was shown that lanthanides were essential as cofactor in a homodimeric MDH comparable with one of the MDHs of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. We hypothesize that the lanthanides provide superior catalytic properties to pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent MDH, which is a key enzyme for both methanotrophs and methylotrophs. Thus far, all isolated MxaF-type MDHs contain calcium as a catalytic cofactor. The gene encoding the MDH of strain SolV was identified to be a xoxF-ortholog, phylogenetically closely related to mxaF. Analysis of the protein structure and alignment of amino acids showed potential REE-binding motifs in XoxF enzymes of many methylotrophs, suggesting that these may also be lanthanide-dependent MDHs. Our findings will have major environmental implications as metagenome studies showed (lanthanide-containing) XoxF-type MDH is much more prominent in nature than MxaF-type enzymes.

  Title: Pyrroloquinoline Quinone Ethanol Dehydrogenase in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 Extends Lanthanide-Dependent Metabolism to Multicarbon Substrates.

  Abstract:
  Lanthanides are utilized by microbial methanol dehydrogenases, and it has been proposed that lanthanides may be important for other type I alcohol dehydrogenases. A triple mutant strain (mxaF xoxF1 xoxF2; named MDH-3), deficient in the three known methanol dehydrogenases of the model methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, is able to grow poorly with methanol if exogenous lanthanides are added to the growth medium. When the gene encoding a putative quinoprotein ethanol dehydrogenase, exaF, was mutated in the MDH-3 background, the quadruple mutant strain could no longer grow on methanol in minimal medium with added lanthanum (La<sup>3+</sup>). ExaF was purified from cells grown with both calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and La<sup>3+</sup> and with Ca<sup>2+</sup> only, and the protein species were studied biochemically. Purified ExaF is a 126-kDa homodimer that preferentially binds La<sup>3+</sup> over Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the active site. UV-visible spectroscopy indicates the presence of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as a cofactor. ExaF purified from the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-plus-La<sup>3+</sup> condition readily oxidizes ethanol and has secondary activities with formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and methanol, whereas ExaF purified from the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-only condition has minimal activity with ethanol as the substrate and activity with methanol is not detectable. The exaF mutant is not affected for growth with ethanol; however, kinetic and in vivo data show that ExaF contributes to ethanol metabolism when La<sup>3+</sup> is present, expanding the role of lanthanides to multicarbon metabolism.<h4>Importance</h4>ExaF is the most efficient PQQ-dependent ethanol dehydrogenase reported to date and, to our knowledge, the first non-XoxF-type alcohol oxidation system reported to use lanthanides as a cofactor, expanding the importance of lanthanides in biochemistry and bacterial metabolism beyond methanol dehydrogenases to multicarbon metabolism. These results support an earlier proposal that an aspartate residue near the catalytic aspartate residue may be an indicator of rare-earth element utilization by type I alcohol dehydrogenases.

  Title: The refined structure of the quinoprotein methanol dehydrogenase from Methylobacterium extorquens at 1.94 A.

  Authors: Ghosh M, Anthony C, Harlos K, Goodwin MG, Blake C.

  Journal:  (1995)

  DOI: 10.1016/s0969-2126(01)00148-4
  PMID: 7735834

  Abstract:
  <h4>Background</h4>Methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) is a bacterial periplasmic quinoprotein; it has pyrrolo-quinoline quinone (PQQ) as its prosthetic group, requires Ca2+ for activity and uses cytochrome cL as its electron acceptor. Low-resolution structures of MDH have already been determined.<h4>Results</h4>The structure of the alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer of MDH from Methylobacterium extorquens has now been determined at 1.94 A with an R-factor of 19.85%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The alpha-subunit of MDH has an eight-fold radial symmetry, with its eight beta-sheets stabilized by a novel tryptophan docking motif. The PQQ in the active site is held in place by a coplanar tryptophan and by a novel disulphide ring formed between adjacent cysteines which are bonded by an unusual non-planar trans peptide bond. One of the carbonyl oxygens of PQQ is bonded to the Ca2+, probably facilitating attack on the substrate, and the other carbonyl oxygen is out of the plane of the ring, confirming the presence of the predicted free-radical semiquinone form of the prosthetic group.

  Title: Isolation and genomic characterization of Novimethylophilus kurashikiensis gen. nov. sp. nov., a new lanthanide-dependent methylotrophic species of Methylophilaceae.

  Authors: Lv H, Sahin N, Tani A.

  Journal:  (2018)

  DOI: 10.1111/1462-2920.14062
  PMID: 29411502

  Abstract:
  Recently, it has been found that two types of methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs) exist in Gram-negative bacterial methylotrophs, calcium-dependent MxaFI-MDH and lanthanide-dependent XoxF-MDH and the latter is more widespread in bacterial genomes. We aimed to isolate and characterize lanthanide-dependent methylotrophs. The growth of strain La2-4<sup>T</sup> on methanol, which was isolated from rice rhizosphere soil, was strictly lanthanide dependent. Its 16S rRNA gene sequence showed only 93.4% identity to that of Methylophilus luteus Mim<sup>T</sup> , and the name Novimethylophilus kurashikiensis gen. nov. sp. nov. is proposed. Its draft genome (ca. 3.69 Mbp, G + C content 56.1 mol%) encodes 3579 putative CDSs and 84 tRNAs. The genome harbors five xoxFs but no mxaFI. XoxF4 was the major MDH in the cells grown on methanol and methylamine, evidenced by protein identification and quantitative PCR analysis. Methylamine dehydrogenase gene was absent in the La2-4<sup>T</sup> genome, while genes for the glutamate-mediated methylamine utilization pathway were detected. The genome also harbors those for the tetrahydromethanopterin and ribulose monophosphate pathways. Additionally, as known species, isolates of Burkholderia ambifaria, Cupriavidus necator and Dyadobacter endophyticus exhibited lanthanide dependent growth on methanol. Thus, lanthanide can be used as an essential growth factor for methylotrophic bacteria that do not harbor MxaFI-MDH.

  Title: Molecular and mutational analysis of a DNA region separating two methylotrophy gene clusters in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1.

  Authors: Chistoserdova L, Lidstrom ME.

  Journal:  (1997)

  DOI: 10.1099/00221287-143-5-1729
  PMID: 9168622

  Abstract:
  A region of 14.2 kb has been analysed that is a part of a locus on the Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 chromosome containing a number of genes involved in one-carbon (C1) metabolism, including serine cycle genes, pqq genes, regulatory methanol oxidation genes and the gene for N5,N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (mtdA). Fifteen new ORFs have been identified within the new region, and their sequences suggest that they encode the following polypeptides: the C-terminal part of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, malyl-CoA lyase, polypeptides of 9.4 and 31 kDa of unknown function, three putative subunits of an ABC-type transporter, two polypeptides similar to the products of mxaF and mxaJ from M. extorquens AM1 and other methylotrophs, a cytochrome c, three enzymes of folate metabolism, and polypeptides of 13 and 20.5 kDa with no homologues in the protein database. Ten insertion mutations have been generated in the region to determine if the newly identified genes are associated with C1 metabolism. A mutation in mclA, encoding malyl-CoA lyase, resulted in a C1-minus phenotype, while mutations in the other genes all showed a C1-plus phenotype. It was not possible to obtain null mutants in a putative folate metabolism gene, folC, implying the necessity of these folate synthesis genes for metabolism of C1 and multicarbon compounds. Mutations in the putative ABC transporter genes, the genes similar to mxaG and mxaJ, and other unidentified ORFs produced double-crossover recombinants with a C1-positive phenotype. Promoter regions have been investigated upstream of orf3 and orf4 using the promoter probe vector pHX200. Transcription from these promoters was weak in wild-type M. extorquens AM1 but increased in regulatory mox mutants.

  Title: Lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase from the legume symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens strain USDA110.

  Abstract:
  The legume symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium, B. diazoefficiens strain USDA110, utilizes methanol for growth in the presence of light lanthanides, such as La<sup>3+</sup>, Ce<sup>3+</sup>, Pr<sup>3+</sup> or Nd<sup>3+</sup>, and its cells possess significant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) activity. We purified MDH to homogeneity from B. diazoefficiens strain USDA110 grown in a methanol/Ce<sup>3+</sup> medium; the protein was identified as XoxF5-type MDH (blr6213). The purified XoxF contained 0.58 cerium atoms per enzyme subunit. Moreover, the in-solution structure of XoxF was analyzed by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis; the radius of gyration (R<sub>g</sub>) and maximum particle dimension (D<sub>max</sub>) of XoxF were calculated to be 32.3 and 96.8 Å, respectively, suggesting that XoxF adopts a dimer structure in solution. These results show that B. diazoefficiens strain USDA110 has XoxF, a lanthanides-dependent MDH, which has methanol oxidation activity and is induced by methanol/lanthanaides, and that lanthanide is one of the important factors in methanol utilization by the strain.

  Title: Scalable and Consolidated Microbial Platform for Rare Earth Element Leaching and Recovery from Waste Sources.

  Authors: Good NM, Kang-Yun CS, Su MZ, Zytnick AM, Barber CC, Vu HN, Grace JM, Nguyen HH, Zhang W, Skovran E, Fan M, Park DM, Martinez-Gomez NC.

  Journal:  (2024)

  DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.3c06775
  PMID: 38150661
  PMCID: PMC10785750

  Abstract:
  Chemical methods for the extraction and refinement of technologically critical rare earth elements (REEs) are energy-intensive, hazardous, and environmentally destructive. Current biobased extraction systems rely on extremophilic organisms and generate many of the same detrimental effects as chemical methodologies. The mesophilic methylotrophic bacterium <i>Methylobacterium extorquens</i> AM1 was previously shown to grow using electronic waste by naturally acquiring REEs to power methanol metabolism. Here we show that growth using electronic waste as a sole REE source is scalable up to 10 L with consistent metal yields without the use of harsh acids or high temperatures. The addition of organic acids increases REE leaching in a nonspecific manner. REE-specific bioleaching can be engineered through the overproduction of REE-binding ligands (called lanthanophores) and pyrroloquinoline quinone. REE bioaccumulation increases with the leachate concentration and is highly specific. REEs are stored intracellularly in polyphosphate granules, and genetic engineering to eliminate exopolyphosphatase activity increases metal accumulation, confirming the link between phosphate metabolism and biological REE use. Finally, we report the innate ability of <i>M. extorquens</i> to grow using other complex REE sources, including pulverized smartphones, demonstrating the flexibility and potential for use as a recovery platform for these critical metals.

  Title: Nucleotide sequence of the Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 moxF and moxJ genes involved in methanol oxidation.

  Authors: Anderson DJ, Morris CJ, Nunn DN, Anthony C, Lidstrom ME.

  Journal:  (1990)

  DOI: 10.1016/0378-1119(90)90457-3
  PMID: 2116368

  Abstract:
  The nucleotide sequence has been determined for two genes involved in methanol oxidation in the facultative methylotroph, Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. The two genes are moxF, encoding the 66-kDa subunit of the methanol dehydrogenase and moxJ, located immediately downstream from moxF, which encodes a 30-kDa protein with unknown function. This information completes the sequence of the 5.86-kb XhoI-SalI fragment containing the moxFJGI region in M. extorquens AM1, and the structure of this gene cluster is presented. Evidence is presented that moxJ is also present in Paracoccus denitrificans. The aa sequence of MoxJ has provided little information concerning its function, but it does appear to contain a signal sequence suggesting a periplasmic location.

  Title: Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) and quinoprotein enzymes.

  Authors: Anthony C.

  Journal:  (2001)

  DOI: 10.1089/15230860152664966
  PMID: 11761326

  Abstract:
  This review summarises the characteristics, identification, and measurement of pyrroloquinoline quinone, the prosthetic group of bacterial quinoprotein dehydrogenases whose structures, mechanisms, and electron transport functions are described in detail. Type I alcohol dehydrogenase includes the "classic" methanol dehydrogenase; its x-ray structure and mechanism are discussed in detail. It is likely that its mechanism involves a direct hydride transfer rather than a mechanism involving a covalent adduct. The x-ray structure of a closely related ethanol dehydrogenase is also described. The type II alcohol dehydrogenase is a soluble quinohaemoprotein, having a C-terminal extension containing haem C, which provides an excellent opportunity for the study of intraprotein electron transfer processes. The type III alcohol dehydrogenase is similar but it has two additional subunits (one of which is a multihaem cytochrome c) bound in an unusual way to the periplasmic membrane. One type of glucose dehydrogenase is a soluble quinoprotein whose role in energy transduction is uncertain. Its x-ray structure (in the presence and absence of substrate) is described together with the detailed mechanism, which also involves a direct hydride transfer. The more widely distributed glucose dehydrogenases are integral membrane proteins, bound to the membrane by transmembrane helices at the N-terminus.

  Title: Methyloceanibacter caenitepidi gen. nov., sp. nov., a facultatively methylotrophic bacterium isolated from marine sediments near a hydrothermal vent.

  Authors: Takeuchi M, Katayama T, Yamagishi T, Hanada S, Tamaki H, Kamagata Y, Oshima K, Hattori M, Marumo K, Nedachi M, Maeda H, Suwa Y, Sakata S.

  PMID: 24096357

  Abstract:
  A moderately thermophilic, methanol-oxidizing bacterium (strain Gela4(T)) was isolated from methane-utilizing mixed-culture originating from marine sediment near a hydrothermal vent. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain Gela4(T) was closely related to members of the genus 'Methyloligella' (94.7% similarity) within the class Alphaproteobacteria. Strain Gela4(T) was a Gram-staining-negative and aerobic organism. Cells were rod-shaped and non-motile. The temperature range for growth of strain Gela4(T) was 19-43 °C (optimal growth at 35 °C). Strain Gela4(T) tolerated up to 9% NaCl with an optimum at 1%. The organism was a facultative methylotroph that could utilize methanol, methylamine, trimethylamine and a variety of multi-carbon compounds. The major cellular fatty acid and major respiratory quinone were C18 : 1ω7c and ubiquinone-10, respectively. The predominant phospholipids were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. The DNA G+C content was 63.9 mol%. On the basis of the morphological, physiological, biochemical and genetic information, a novel genus and species, Methyloceanibacter caenitepidi is proposed, with Gela4(T) ( = NBRC 109540(T) = DSM 27242(T)) as the type strain.

  Title: PQQ-dependent methanol dehydrogenases: rare-earth elements make a difference.

  Authors: Keltjens JT, Pol A, Reimann J, Op den Camp HJ.

  Journal:  (2014)

  DOI: 10.1007/s00253-014-5766-8
  PMID: 24816778

  Abstract:
  Methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) catalyzes the first step in methanol use by methylotrophic bacteria and the second step in methane conversion by methanotrophs. Gram-negative bacteria possess an MDH with pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as its catalytic center. This MDH belongs to the broad class of eight-bladed β propeller quinoproteins, which comprise a range of other alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases. A well-investigated MDH is the heterotetrameric MxaFI-MDH, which is composed of two large catalytic subunits (MxaF) and two small subunits (MxaI). MxaFI-MDHs bind calcium as a cofactor that assists PQQ in catalysis. Genomic analyses indicated the existence of another MDH distantly related to the MxaFI-MDHs. Recently, several of these so-called XoxF-MDHs have been isolated. XoxF-MDHs described thus far are homodimeric proteins lacking the small subunit and possess a rare-earth element (REE) instead of calcium. The presence of such REE may confer XoxF-MDHs a superior catalytic efficiency. Moreover, XoxF-MDHs are able to oxidize methanol to formate, rather than to formaldehyde as MxaFI-MDHs do. While structures of MxaFI- and XoxF-MDH are conserved, also regarding the binding of PQQ, the accommodation of a REE requires the presence of a specific aspartate residue near the catalytic site. XoxF-MDHs containing such REE-binding motif are abundantly present in genomes of methylotrophic and methanotrophic microorganisms and also in organisms that hitherto are not known for such lifestyle. Moreover, sequence analyses suggest that XoxF-MDHs represent only a small part of putative REE-containing quinoproteins, together covering an unexploited potential of metabolic functions.

  Title: The Chemistry of Lanthanides in Biology: Recent Discoveries, Emerging Principles, and Technological Applications.

  Authors: [From original CMM/PFAS dataset]

  Journal: [See PMID for details]

  PMID: 31572776

  Abstract:
  The essential biological role of rare earth elements lay hidden until the discovery in 2011 that lanthanides are specifically incorporated into a bacterial methanol dehydrogenase. Only recently has this observation gone from a curiosity to a major research area, with the appreciation for the widespread nature of lanthanide-utilizing organisms in the environment and the discovery of other lanthanide-binding proteins and systems for selective uptake. While seemingly exotic at first glance, biological utilization of lanthanides is very logical from a chemical perspective. The early lanthanides (La, Ce, Pr, Nd) primarily used by biology are abundant in the environment, perform similar chemistry to other biologically useful metals and do so more efficiently due to higher Lewis acidity, and possess sufficiently distinct coordination chemistry to allow for selective uptake, trafficking, and incorporation into enzymes. Indeed, recent advances in the field illustrate clear analogies with the biological coordination chemistry of other metals, particularly CaII and FeIII, but with unique twists-including cooperative metal binding to magnify the effects of small ionic radius differences-enabling selectivity. This Outlook summarizes the recent developments in this young but rapidly expanding field and looks forward to potential future discoveries, emphasizing continuity with principles of bioinorganic chemistry established by studies of other metals. We also highlight how a more thorough understanding of the central chemical question-selective lanthanide recognition in biology-may impact the challenging problems of sensing, capture, recycling, and separations of rare earths.

  Title: Application of Omics Approaches to Studying Methylotrophs and Methylotroph Comunities.

  Authors: Chistoserdova L.

  Journal:  (2017)

  DOI: 10.21775/cimb.024.119
  PMID: 28686571

  Abstract:
  This review covers some recent advances in application of omics technologies to studying methylotrophs, with special reference to their activities in natural environments. Some of the developments highlighted in this review are the new outlook at the role of the XoxF-type, lanthanum-dependent methanol dehydrogenase in natural habitats, new mechanistic details of methane oxidation through the reverse methanogenesis pathway, propensity of 'aerobic' methanotrophs to thrive in hypoxic environments and potential connection of this process to denitrification, and a novel outlook at methane oxidation as a community function.

  This review covers some recent advances in application of omics technologies to studying methylotrophs, with special reference to their activities in natural environments. Some of the developments highlighted in this review are the new outlook at the role of the XoxF-type, lanthanum-dependent methanol dehydrogenase in natural habitats, new mechanistic details of methane oxidation through the reverse methanogenesis pathway, propensity of 'aerobic' methanotrophs to thrive in hypoxic environments and potential connection of this process to denitrification, and a novel outlook at methane oxidation as a community function.

  Title: XoxF encoding an alternative methanol dehydrogenase is widespread in coastal marine environments.

  Authors: Taubert M, Grob C, Howat AM, Burns OJ, Dixon JL, Chen Y, Murrell JC.

  Journal:  (2015)

  DOI: 10.1111/1462-2920.12896
  PMID: 25943904

  Abstract:
  The xoxF gene, encoding a pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent methanol dehydrogenase, is found in all known proteobacterial methylotrophs. In several newly discovered methylotrophs, XoxF is the active methanol dehydrogenase, catalysing the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. Apart from that, its potential role in methylotrophy and carbon cycling is unknown. So far, the diversity of xoxF in the environment has received little attention. We designed PCR primer sets targeting clades of the xoxF gene, and used 454 pyrosequencing of PCR amplicons obtained from the DNA of four coastal marine environments for a unique assessment of the diversity of xoxF in these habitats. Phylogenetic analysis of the data obtained revealed a high diversity of xoxF genes from two of the investigated clades, and substantial differences in sequence composition between environments. Sequences were classified as being related to a wide range of both methylotrophs and non-methylotrophs from Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. The most prominent sequences detected were related to the family Rhodobacteraceae, the genus Methylotenera and the OM43 clade of Methylophilales, and are thus related to organisms that employ XoxF for methanol oxidation. Furthermore, our analyses revealed a high degree of so far undescribed sequences, suggesting a high number of unknown bacterial species in these habitats.

  Title: Functional Role of Lanthanides in Enzymatic Activity and Transcriptional Regulation of Pyrroloquinoline Quinone-Dependent Alcohol Dehydrogenases in <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> KT2440.

  Authors: Wehrmann M, Billard P, Martin-Meriadec A, Zegeye A, Klebensberger J.

  Abstract:
  The oxidation of alcohols and aldehydes is crucial for detoxification and efficient catabolism of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Thus, many Gram-negative bacteria have evolved periplasmic oxidation systems based on pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (PQQ-ADHs) that are often functionally redundant. Here we report the first description and characterization of a lanthanide-dependent PQQ-ADH (PedH) in a nonmethylotrophic bacterium based on the use of purified enzymes from the soil-dwelling model organism <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> KT2440. PedH (PP_2679) exhibits enzyme activity on a range of substrates similar to that of its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent counterpart PedE (PP_2674), including linear and aromatic primary and secondary alcohols, as well as aldehydes, but only in the presence of lanthanide ions, including La<sup>3+</sup>, Ce<sup>3+</sup>, Pr<sup>3+</sup>, Sm<sup>3+</sup>, or Nd<sup>3+</sup> Reporter assays revealed that PedH not only has a catalytic function but is also involved in the transcriptional regulation of <i>pedE</i> and <i>pedH</i>, most likely acting as a sensory module. Notably, the underlying regulatory network is responsive to as little as 1 to 10 nM lanthanum, a concentration assumed to be of ecological relevance. The present study further demonstrates that the PQQ-dependent oxidation system is crucial for efficient growth with a variety of volatile alcohols. From these results, we conclude that functional redundancy and inverse regulation of PedE and PedH represent an adaptive strategy of <i>P. putida</i> KT2440 to optimize growth with volatile alcohols in response to the availability of different lanthanides.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Because of their low bioavailability, lanthanides have long been considered biologically inert. In recent years, however, the identification of lanthanides as a cofactor in methylotrophic bacteria has attracted tremendous interest among various biological fields. The present study reveals that one of the two PQQ-ADHs produced by the model organism <i>P. putida</i> KT2440 also utilizes lanthanides as a cofactor, thus expanding the scope of lanthanide-employing bacteria beyond the methylotrophs. Similar to the system described in methylotrophic bacteria, a complex regulatory network is involved in lanthanide-responsive switching between the two PQQ-ADHs encoded by <i>P. putida</i> KT2440. We further show that the functional production of at least one of the enzymes is crucial for efficient growth with several volatile alcohols. Overall, our study provides a novel understanding of the redundancy of PQQ-ADHs observed in many organisms and further highlights the importance of lanthanides for bacterial metabolism, particularly in soil environments.

  Title: The active site of methanol dehydrogenase contains a disulphide bridge between adjacent cysteine residues.

  Authors: Blake CC, Ghosh M, Harlos K, Avezoux A, Anthony C.

  Journal:  (1994)

  DOI: 10.1038/nsb0294-102
  PMID: 7656012

  Abstract:
  Adjacent cysteine residues can only form disulphide bridges in a distorted structure containing a cis-peptide link. Such bridges are extremely uncommon, identified so far in the acetyl choline receptor alone where the structure of the bridge is undetermined. Here we present the first molecular description of a disulphide bridge of this type in the quinoprotein methanol dehydrogenase from Methylobacterium extorquens. We show that this structure occurs in close proximity to the pyrrolo-quinoline quinone prosthetic group and a calcium ion in the active site of the enzyme. This unusual disulphide bridge appears to play a role in the electron transfer reaction mediated by methanol dehydrogenase.

  Title: Site-directed mutagenesis and X-ray crystallography of the PQQ-containing quinoprotein methanol dehydrogenase and its electron acceptor, cytochrome c(L).

  Authors: Afolabi PR, Mohammed F, Amaratunga K, Majekodunmi O, Dales SL, Gill R, Thompson D, Cooper JB, Wood SP, Goodwin PM, Anthony C.

  Journal:  (2001)

  Abstract:
  Two proteins specifically involved in methanol oxidation in the methylotrophic bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens have been modified by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of the proposed active site base (Asp303) to glutamate in methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) gave an active enzyme (D303E-MDH) with a greatly reduced affinity for substrate and with a lower activation energy. Results of kinetic and deuterium isotope studies showed that the essential mechanism in the mutant protein was unchanged, and that the step requiring activation by ammonia remained rate limiting. No spectrally detectable intermediates could be observed during the reaction. The X-ray structure, determined to 3 A resolution, of D303E-MDH showed that the position and coordination geometry of the Ca2+ ion in the active site was altered; the larger Glu303 side chain was coordinated to the Ca2+ ion and also hydrogen bonded to the O5 atom of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ). The properties and structure of the D303E-MDH are consistent with the previous proposal that the reaction in MDH is initiated by proton abstraction involving Asp303, and that the mechanism involves a direct hydride transfer reaction. Mutation of the two adjacent cysteine residues that make up the novel disulfide ring in the active site of MDH led to an inactive enzyme, confirming the essential role of this remarkable ring structure. Mutations of cytochrome c(L), which is the electron acceptor from MDH was used to identify Met109 as the sixth ligand to the heme.

  Abstract:
  Only three biological pathways are known to produce oxygen: photosynthesis, chlorate respiration and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Here we present evidence for a fourth pathway, possibly of considerable geochemical and evolutionary importance. The pathway was discovered after metagenomic sequencing of an enrichment culture that couples anaerobic oxidation of methane with the reduction of nitrite to dinitrogen. The complete genome of the dominant bacterium, named 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera', was assembled. This apparently anaerobic, denitrifying bacterium encoded, transcribed and expressed the well-established aerobic pathway for methane oxidation, whereas it lacked known genes for dinitrogen production. Subsequent isotopic labelling indicated that 'M. oxyfera' bypassed the denitrification intermediate nitrous oxide by the conversion of two nitric oxide molecules to dinitrogen and oxygen, which was used to oxidize methane. These results extend our understanding of hydrocarbon degradation under anoxic conditions and explain the biochemical mechanism of a poorly understood freshwater methane sink. Because nitrogen oxides were already present on early Earth, our finding opens up the possibility that oxygen was available to microbial metabolism before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.

  Abstract:
  In the methylotrophic bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens strain AM1, MxaF, a Ca(2+)-dependent methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), is the main enzyme catalyzing methanol oxidation during growth on methanol. The genome of strain AM1 contains another MDH gene homologue, xoxF1, whose function in methanol metabolism has remained unclear. In this work, we show that XoxF1 also functions as an MDH and is La(3+)-dependent. Despite the absence of Ca(2+) in the medium strain AM1 was able to grow on methanol in the presence of La(3+). Addition of La(3+) increased MDH activity but the addition had no effect on mxaF or xoxF1 expression level. We purified MDH from strain AM1 grown on methanol in the presence of La(3+), and its N-terminal amino acid sequence corresponded to that of XoxF1. The enzyme contained La(3+) as a cofactor. The ΔmxaF mutant strain could not grow on methanol in the presence of Ca(2+), but was able to grow after supplementation with La(3+). Taken together, these results show that XoxF1 participates in methanol metabolism as a La(3+)-dependent MDH in strain AM1.

  Title: Siderophore for Lanthanide and Iron Uptake for Methylotrophy and Plant Growth Promotion in Methylobacterium aquaticum Strain 22A.

  Authors: [From original CMM/PFAS dataset]

  Journal: [See PMID for details]

  PMID: 35875576

  Abstract:
  Methylobacterium and Methylorubrum species are facultative methylotrophic bacteria that are abundant in the plant phyllosphere. They have two methanol dehydrogenases, MxaF and XoxF, which are dependent on either calcium or lanthanides (Lns), respectively. Lns exist as insoluble minerals in nature, and their solubilization and uptake require a siderophore-like substance (lanthanophore). Methylobacterium species have also been identified as plant growth-promoting bacteria although the actual mechanism has not been well-investigated. This study aimed to reveal the roles of siderophore in Methylobacterium aquaticum strain 22A in Ln uptake, bacterial physiology, and plant growth promotion. The strain 22A genome contains an eight-gene cluster encoding the staphyloferrin B-like (sbn) siderophore. We demonstrate that the sbn siderophore gene cluster is necessary for growth under low iron conditions and was complemented by supplementation with citrate or spent medium of the wild type or other strains of the genera. The siderophore exhibited adaptive features, including tolerance to oxidative and nitrosative stress, biofilm formation, and heavy metal sequestration. The contribution of the siderophore to plant growth was shown by the repressive growth of duckweed treated with siderophore mutant under iron-limited conditions; however, the siderophore was dispensable for strain 22A to colonize the phyllosphere. Importantly, the siderophore mutant could not grow on methanol, but the siderophore could solubilize insoluble Ln oxide, suggesting its critical role in methylotrophy. We also identified TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs) for the siderophore-iron complex, iron citrate, and Ln, among 12 TBDRs in strain 22A. Analysis of the siderophore synthesis gene clusters and TBDR genes in Methylobacterium genomes revealed the existence of diverse types of siderophores and TBDRs. Methylorubrum species have an exclusive TBDR for Ln uptake that has been identified as LutH. Collectively, the results of this study provide insight into the importance of the sbn siderophore in Ln chelation, bacterial physiology, and the diversity of siderophore and TBDRs in Methylobacterium species.

  Title: Contrasting in vitro and in vivo methanol oxidation activities of lanthanide-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases XoxF1 and ExaF from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1.

  Authors: Good NM, Moore RS, Suriano CJ, Martinez-Gomez NC.

  Journal:  (2019)

  PMCID: PMC6414531

  Abstract:
  Lanthanide (Ln) elements are utilized as cofactors for catalysis by XoxF-type methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs). A primary assumption is that XoxF enzymes produce formate from methanol oxidation, which could impact organisms that require formaldehyde for assimilation. We report genetic and phenotypic evidence showing that XoxF1 (MexAM1_1740) from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 produces formaldehyde, and not formate, during growth with methanol. Enzyme purified with lanthanum or neodymium oxidizes formaldehyde. However, formaldehyde oxidation via 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol (DCPIP) reduction is not detected in cell-free extracts from wild-type strain methanol- and lanthanum-grown cultures. Formaldehyde activating enzyme (Fae) is required for Ln methylotrophic growth, demonstrating that XoxF1-mediated production of formaldehyde is essential. Addition of exogenous lanthanum increases growth rate with methanol by 9-12% but does not correlate with changes to methanol consumption or formaldehyde accumulation. Transcriptomics analysis of lanthanum methanol growth shows upregulation of xox1 and downregulation of mxa genes, consistent with the Ln-switch, no differential expression of formaldehyde conversion genes, downregulation of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) biosynthesis genes, and upregulation of fdh4 formate dehydrogenase (FDH) genes. Additionally, the Ln-dependent ethanol dehydrogenase ExaF reduces methanol sensitivity in the fae mutant strain when lanthanides are present, providing evidence for the capacity of an auxiliary role for ExaF during Ln-dependent methylotrophy.

  Title: Contrasting in vitro and in vivo methanol oxidation activities of lanthanide-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases XoxF1 and ExaF from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1.

  Authors: Good NM, Moore RS, Suriano CJ, Martinez-Gomez NC.

  Abstract:
  Lanthanide (Ln) elements are utilized as cofactors for catalysis by XoxF-type methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs). A primary assumption is that XoxF enzymes produce formate from methanol oxidation, which could impact organisms that require formaldehyde for assimilation. We report genetic and phenotypic evidence showing that XoxF1 (MexAM1_1740) from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 produces formaldehyde, and not formate, during growth with methanol. Enzyme purified with lanthanum or neodymium oxidizes formaldehyde. However, formaldehyde oxidation via 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol (DCPIP) reduction is not detected in cell-free extracts from wild-type strain methanol- and lanthanum-grown cultures. Formaldehyde activating enzyme (Fae) is required for Ln methylotrophic growth, demonstrating that XoxF1-mediated production of formaldehyde is essential. Addition of exogenous lanthanum increases growth rate with methanol by 9-12% but does not correlate with changes to methanol consumption or formaldehyde accumulation. Transcriptomics analysis of lanthanum methanol growth shows upregulation of xox1 and downregulation of mxa genes, consistent with the Ln-switch, no differential expression of formaldehyde conversion genes, downregulation of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) biosynthesis genes, and upregulation of fdh4 formate dehydrogenase (FDH) genes. Additionally, the Ln-dependent ethanol dehydrogenase ExaF reduces methanol sensitivity in the fae mutant strain when lanthanides are present, providing evidence for the capacity of an auxiliary role for ExaF during Ln-dependent methylotrophy.

  Title: Lanmodulin: A Highly Selective Lanthanide-Binding Protein from a Lanthanide-Utilizing Bacterium.

  Authors: Cotruvo JA, Featherston ER, Mattocks JA, Ho JV, Laremore TN.

  Journal:  (2018)

  DOI: 10.1021/jacs.8b09842
  PMID: 30351021

  Abstract:
  Lanthanides (Lns) have been shown recently to be essential cofactors in certain enzymes in methylotrophic bacteria. Here we identify in the model methylotroph, Methylobacterium extorquens, a highly selective Ln<sup>III</sup>-binding protein, which we name lanmodulin (LanM). LanM possesses four metal-binding EF hand motifs, commonly associated with Ca<sup>II</sup>-binding proteins. In contrast to other EF hand-containing proteins, however, LanM undergoes a large conformational change from a largely disordered state to a compact, ordered state in response to picomolar concentrations of all Ln<sup>III</sup> (Ln = La-Lu, Y), whereas it only responds to Ca<sup>II</sup> at near-millimolar concentrations. Mutagenesis of conserved proline residues present in LanM's EF hands, not encountered in Ca<sup>II</sup>-binding EF hands, to alanine pushes Ca<sup>II</sup> responsiveness into the micromolar concentration range while retaining picomolar Ln<sup>III</sup> affinity, suggesting that these unique proline residues play a key role in ensuring metal selectivity in vivo. Identification and characterization of LanM provides insights into how biology selectively recognizes low-abundance Ln<sup>III</sup> over higher-abundance Ca<sup>II</sup>, pointing toward biotechnologies for detecting, sequestering, and separating these technologically important elements.

  Title: Genome information of Methylobacterium oryzae, a plant-probiotic methylotroph in the phyllosphere.

  Authors: Kwak MJ, Jeong H, Madhaiyan M, Lee Y, Sa TM, Oh TK, Kim JF.

  Journal:  (2014)

  PMCID: PMC4161386

  Abstract:
  Pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophs in the Rhizobiales are widespread in the environment, and many Methylobacterium species associated with plants produce plant growth-promoting substances. To gain insights into the life style at the phyllosphere and the genetic bases of plant growth promotion, we determined and analyzed the complete genome sequence of Methylobacterium oryzae CBMB20T, a strain isolated from rice stem. The genome consists of a 6.29-Mb chromosome and four plasmids, designated as pMOC1 to pMOC4. Among the 6,274 coding sequences in the chromosome, the bacterium has, besides most of the genes for the central metabolism, all of the essential genes for the assimilation and dissimilation of methanol that are either located in methylotrophy islands or dispersed. M. oryzae is equipped with several kinds of genes for adaptation to plant surfaces such as defense against UV radiation, oxidative stress, desiccation, or nutrient deficiency, as well as high proportion of genes related to motility and signaling. Moreover, it has an array of genes involved in metabolic pathways that may contribute to promotion of plant growth; they include auxin biosynthesis, cytokine biosynthesis, vitamin B12 biosynthesis, urea metabolism, biosorption of heavy metals or decrease of metal toxicity, pyrroloquinoline quinone biosynthesis, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deamination, phosphate solubilization, and thiosulfate oxidation. Through the genome analysis of M. oryzae, we provide information on the full gene complement of M. oryzae that resides in the aerial parts of plants and enhances plant growth. The plant-associated lifestyle of M. oryzae pertaining to methylotrophy and plant growth promotion, and its potential as a candidate for a bioinoculant targeted to the phyllosphere and focused on phytostimulation are illuminated.

  Title: Marine methylotrophs revealed by stable-isotope probing, multiple displacement amplification and metagenomics.

  Authors: Neufeld JD, Chen Y, Dumont MG, Murrell JC.

  Journal:  (2008)

  DOI: 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2008.01568.x
  PMID: 18294205

  Abstract:
  The concentrations of one-carbon substrates that fuel methylotrophic microbial communities in the ocean are limited and the specialized guilds of bacteria that use these molecules may exist at low relative abundance. As a result, these organisms are difficult to identify and are often missed with existing cultivation and gene retrieval methods. Here, we demonstrate a novel proof of concept: using environmentally-relevant substrate concentrations in stable-isotope probing (SIP) incubations to yield sufficient DNA for large-insert metagenomic analysis through multiple displacement amplification (MDA). A marine surface-water sample was labelled sufficiently by incubation with near in situ concentrations of methanol. Picogram quantities of labelled (13)C-DNA were purified from caesium chloride gradients, amplified with MDA to produce microgram amounts of high-molecular-weight DNA (<or= 40 kb) and cloned to produce a fosmid library of > 10 000 clones. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) demonstrated minimal bias associated with the MDA step and implicated Methylophaga-like phylotypes with the marine metabolism of methanol. Polymerase chain reaction screening of 1500 clones revealed a methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) containing insert and shotgun sequencing of this insert resulted in the assembly of a 9-kb fragment of DNA encoding a cluster of enzymes involved in MDH biosynthesis, regulation and assembly. This novel combination of methodology enables future structure-function studies of microbial communities to achieve the long-desired goal of identifying active microbial populations using in situ conditions and performing a directed metagenomic analysis for these ecologically relevant microorganisms.

  Title: Genome- and Community-Level Interaction Insights into Carbon Utilization and Element Cycling Functions of <i>Hydrothermarchaeota</i> in Hydrothermal Sediment.

  Authors: Zhou Z, Liu Y, Xu W, Pan J, Luo ZH, Li M.

  Journal:  (2020)

  DOI: 10.1128/msystems.00795-19
  PMID: 31911466
  PMCID: PMC6946796

  Abstract:
  Hydrothermal vents release reduced compounds and small organic carbon compounds into the surrounding seawater, providing essential substrates for microbial growth and bioenergy transformations. Despite the wide distribution of the marine benthic group E archaea (referred to as <i>Hydrothermarchaeota</i>) in the hydrothermal environment, little is known about their genomic repertoires and biogeochemical significance. Here, we studied four highly complete (>80%) metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from a black smoker chimney and the surrounding sulfur-rich sediments on the South Atlantic Mid-Ocean Ridge and publicly available data sets (the Integrated Microbial Genomes system of the U.S. Department of Energy-Joint Genome Institute and NCBI SRA data sets). Genomic analysis suggested a wide carbon metabolic diversity of <i>Hydrothermarchaeota</i> members, including the utilization of proteins, lactate, and acetate; the anaerobic degradation of aromatics; the oxidation of C<sub>1</sub> compounds (CO, formate, and formaldehyde); the utilization of methyl compounds; CO<sub>2</sub> incorporation by the tetrahydromethanopterin-based Wood-Ljungdahl pathway; and participation in the type III ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase-based Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. These microbes also potentially oxidize sulfur, arsenic, and hydrogen and engage in anaerobic respiration based on sulfate reduction and denitrification. Among the 140 MAGs reconstructed from the black smoker chimney microbial community (including <i>Hydrothermarchaeota</i> MAGs), community-level metabolic predictions suggested a redundancy of carbon utilization and element cycling functions and interactive syntrophic and sequential utilization of substrates. These processes might make various carbon and energy sources widely accessible to the microorganisms. Further, the analysis suggested that <i>Hydrothermarchaeota</i> members contained important functional components obtained from the community via lateral gene transfer, becoming a distinctive clade. This might serve as a niche-adaptive strategy for metabolizing heavy metals, C<sub>1</sub> compounds, and reduced sulfur compounds. Collectively, the analysis provides comprehensive metabolic insights into the <i>Hydrothermarchaeota</i> <b>IMPORTANCE</b> This study provides comprehensive metabolic insights into the <i>Hydrothermarchaeota</i> from comparative genomics, evolution, and community-level perspectives. Members of the <i>Hydrothermarchaeota</i> synergistically participate in a wide range of carbon-utilizing and element cycling processes with other microorganisms in the community. We expand the current understanding of community interactions within the hydrothermal sediment and chimney, suggesting that microbial interactions based on sequential substrate metabolism are essential to nutrient and element cycling.

  Title: Lanthanide-induced conformational change of methanol dehydrogenase involving coordination change of cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone.

  Authors: Tsushima S.

  Journal:  (2019)

  DOI: 10.1039/c9cp03953h
  PMID: 31552950

  Abstract:
  There is emerging interest in the role of lanthanides as cofactors for XoxF-type methanol dehydrogenase (MDH). Here, classical molecular dynamics simulations combined with fragment molecular orbital calculations were employed to rationalize the enzymatic activities of MDH (both XoxF- and MxaF-types) carrying different lanthanides. In XoxF-type MDH, lanthanide binding to cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone was found to switch from tridentate to unidentate fashion as it switches from lighter to heavier lanthanides. This fact possibly plays a crucial role in the enzymatic activity exclusive to XoxF-type MDH incorporating lighter lanthanides.

  Abstract:
  Methylomicrobium strains are widespread in saline environments. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z, a haloalkaliphilic methanotrophic bacterium, which will provide the basis for detailed characterization of the core pathways of both single-carbon metabolism and responses to osmotic and high-pH stresses. Final assembly of the genome sequence revealed that this bacterium contains a 128-kb plasmid, making M. alcaliphilum 20Z the first methanotrophic bacterium of known genome sequence for which a plasmid has been reported.

  Title: MxaY regulates the lanthanide-mediated methanol dehydrogenase switch in Methylomicrobium buryatense.

  Authors: [From original CMM/PFAS dataset]

  Journal: [See PMID for details]

  PMID: 27651996

  Abstract:
  Many methylotrophs, microorganisms that consume carbon compounds lacking carbon-carbon bonds, use two different systems to oxidize methanol for energy production and biomass accumulation. The MxaFI methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) contains calcium in its active site, while the XoxF enzyme contains a lanthanide in its active site. The genes encoding the MDH enzymes are differentially regulated by the presence of lanthanides. In this study, we found that the histidine kinase MxaY controls the lanthanide-mediated switch in Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1C. MxaY controls the transcription of genes encoding MxaFI and XoxF at least partially by controlling the transcript levels of the orphan response regulator MxaB. We identify a constitutively active version of MxaY, and identify the mutated residue that may be involved in lanthanide sensing. Lastly, we find evidence to suggest that tight control of active MDH production is required for wild-type growth rates.

  Title: Structure and protein-protein interactions of methanol dehydrogenase from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath).

  Authors: Culpepper MA, Rosenzweig AC.

  Journal:  (2014)

  DOI: 10.1021/bi500850j
  PMID: 25185034
  PMCID: PMC4188263

  Abstract:
  In the initial steps of their metabolic pathway, methanotrophic bacteria oxidize methane to methanol with methane monooxygenases (MMOs) and methanol to formaldehyde with methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs). Several lines of evidence suggest that the membrane-bound or particulate MMO (pMMO) and MDH interact to form a metabolic supercomplex. To further investigate the possible existence of such a supercomplex, native MDH from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) has been purified and characterized by size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering and X-ray crystallography. M. capsulatus (Bath) MDH is primarily a dimer in solution, although an oligomeric species with a molecular mass of ∼450-560 kDa forms at higher protein concentrations. The 2.57 Å resolution crystal structure reveals an overall fold and α2β2 dimeric architecture similar to those of other MDH structures. In addition, biolayer interferometry studies demonstrate specific protein-protein interactions between MDH and M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO as well as between MDH and the truncated recombinant periplasmic domains of M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO (spmoB). These interactions exhibit KD values of 833 ± 409 nM and 9.0 ± 7.7 μM, respectively. The biochemical data combined with analysis of the crystal lattice interactions observed in the MDH structure suggest a model in which MDH and pMMO associate not as a discrete, stoichiometric complex but as a larger assembly scaffolded by the intracytoplasmic membranes.

  Title: Methylobacterium nodulans sp. nov., for a group of aerobic, facultatively methylotrophic, legume root-nodule-forming and nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

  Authors: Jourand P, Giraud E, Béna G, Sy A, Willems A, Gillis M, Dreyfus B, de Lajudie P.

  Journal:  (2004)

  DOI: 10.1099/ijs.0.02902-0
  PMID: 15545469

  Abstract:
  Data on 72 non-pigmented bacterial strains that specifically induce nitrogen-fixing root nodules on the legume species Crotalaria glaucoides, Crotalaria perrottetii and Crotalaria podocarpa are reviewed. By SDS-PAGE analysis of total protein patterns and by 16S rRNA PCR-RFLP, these strains form a homogeneous group that is separate from other legume root-nodule-forming bacteria. The 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny indicates that these bacteria belong to the genus Methylobacterium. They can grow on C(1) compounds such as methanol, formate and formaldehyde but not methylamine as sole carbon source, and carry an mxaF gene, encoding methanol dehydrogenase, which supports their methylotrophic metabolism. Presence of a nodA nodulation gene, and ability to nodulate plants of Crotalaria species and to fix nitrogen are features that separate the strains currently included in this group from other members of the genus Methylobacterium. The present study includes additional genotypic and phenotypic characterization of this novel Methylobacterium species, i.e. nifH gene sequence, morphology, physiology, enzymic and carbon source assimilation tests and antibiotic resistance. The name Methylobacterium nodulans sp. nov. (type strain, ORS 2060(T)=CNCM I 2342(T)=LMG 21967(T)) is proposed for this group of root-nodule-forming bacteria.

  Title: Similar but Not the Same: First Kinetic and Structural Analyses of a Methanol Dehydrogenase Containing a Europium Ion in the Active Site.

  Authors: Jahn B, Pol A, Lumpe H, Barends TRM, Dietl A, Hogendoorn C, Op den Camp HJM, Daumann LJ.

  Journal:  (2018)

  Abstract:
  Since the discovery of the biological relevance of rare earth elements (REEs) for numerous different bacteria, questions concerning the advantages of REEs in the active sites of methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs) over calcium(II) and of why bacteria prefer light REEs have been a subject of debate. Here we report the cultivation and purification of the strictly REE-dependent methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV with europium(III), as well as structural and kinetic analyses of the first methanol dehydrogenase incorporating Eu in the active site. Crystal structure determination of the Eu-MDH demonstrated that overall no major structural changes were induced by conversion to this REE. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were used to determine optimal conditions for kinetic assays, whereas inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) showed 70 % incorporation of Eu in the enzyme. Our studies explain why bacterial growth of SolV in the presence of Eu<sup>3+</sup> is significantly slower than in the presence of La<sup>3+</sup> /Ce<sup>3+</sup> /Pr<sup>3+</sup> : Eu-MDH possesses a decreased catalytic efficiency. Although REEs have similar properties, the differences in ionic radii and coordination numbers across the series significantly impact MDH efficiency.

  Abstract:
  Since the discovery of the biological relevance of rare earth elements (REEs) for numerous different bacteria, questions concerning the advantages of REEs in the active sites of methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs) over calcium(II) and of why bacteria prefer light REEs have been a subject of debate. Here we report the cultivation and purification of the strictly REE-dependent methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV with europium(III), as well as structural and kinetic analyses of the first methanol dehydrogenase incorporating Eu in the active site. Crystal structure determination of the Eu-MDH demonstrated that overall no major structural changes were induced by conversion to this REE. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were used to determine optimal conditions for kinetic assays, whereas inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) showed 70 % incorporation of Eu in the enzyme. Our studies explain why bacterial growth of SolV in the presence of Eu<sup>3+</sup> is significantly slower than in the presence of La<sup>3+</sup> /Ce<sup>3+</sup> /Pr<sup>3+</sup> : Eu-MDH possesses a decreased catalytic efficiency. Although REEs have similar properties, the differences in ionic radii and coordination numbers across the series significantly impact MDH efficiency.
