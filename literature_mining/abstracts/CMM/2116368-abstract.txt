Abstract:
The nucleotide sequence has been determined for two genes involved in methanol oxidation in the facultative methylotroph, Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. The two genes are moxF, encoding the 66-kDa subunit of the methanol dehydrogenase and moxJ, located immediately downstream from moxF, which encodes a 30-kDa protein with unknown function. This information completes the sequence of the 5.86-kb XhoI-SalI fragment containing the moxFJGI region in M. extorquens AM1, and the structure of this gene cluster is presented. Evidence is presented that moxJ is also present in Paracoccus denitrificans. The aa sequence of MoxJ has provided little information concerning its function, but it does appear to contain a signal sequence suggesting a periplasmic location.
