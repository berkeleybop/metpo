  Abstract:
  The concentrations of one-carbon substrates that fuel methylotrophic microbial communities in the ocean are limited and the specialized guilds of bacteria that use these molecules may exist at low relative abundance. As a result, these organisms are difficult to identify and are often missed with existing cultivation and gene retrieval methods. Here, we demonstrate a novel proof of concept: using environmentally-relevant substrate concentrations in stable-isotope probing (SIP) incubations to yield sufficient DNA for large-insert metagenomic analysis through multiple displacement amplification (MDA). A marine surface-water sample was labelled sufficiently by incubation with near in situ concentrations of methanol. Picogram quantities of labelled (13)C-DNA were purified from caesium chloride gradients, amplified with MDA to produce microgram amounts of high-molecular-weight DNA (<or= 40 kb) and cloned to produce a fosmid library of > 10 000 clones. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) demonstrated minimal bias associated with the MDA step and implicated Methylophaga-like phylotypes with the marine metabolism of methanol. Polymerase chain reaction screening of 1500 clones revealed a methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) containing insert and shotgun sequencing of this insert resulted in the assembly of a 9-kb fragment of DNA encoding a cluster of enzymes involved in MDH biosynthesis, regulation and assembly. This novel combination of methodology enables future structure-function studies of microbial communities to achieve the long-desired goal of identifying active microbial populations using in situ conditions and performing a directed metagenomic analysis for these ecologically relevant microorganisms.

  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  pmid: <PubMed ID of the article (e.g., 23996836)>
  study_taxa: <semicolon-separated list of the main bacterial or archaeal taxa being studied for chemical utilization>
  strains: <Extract ONLY the strain designation part (e.g., "DA-C8", "MG1655", "ATCC 25922") WITHOUT genus/species prefixes. Focus on strain numbers, culture collection codes, and isolate identifiers. Automatically remove terminal "T" or "(T)" suffixes as these indicate type strain status (e.g., "DA-C8T" becomes "DA-C8", "K13T" becomes "K13"). Include strain numbers, culture collection numbers, and isolate names, but NOT the full taxonomic context.>
  chemicals_mentioned: <Identify all chemical compounds mentioned in the text that are relevant to bacterial metabolism, growth, or biochemical activities. Include: carbon sources (glucose, acetate), nitrogen sources (ammonia, nitrate), vitamins (B12, biotin), metabolic intermediates, enzyme substrates, electron acceptors/donors, and any other chemicals involved in bacterial physiology. If no relevant chemicals are mentioned,  leave this field completely empty. DO NOT include entries like "None  explicitly mentioned" or similar phrases.>
  chemical_utilizations: <A semicolon-separated list of strain-chemical relationships. Use EXACTLY THE SAME strain identifiers from the strains field.
  Extract ALL relationships mentioned in the text. Be comprehensive - include both what strains CAN do and what they CANNOT do. Use specific predicates (uses_as_carbon_source, degrades, oxidizes) rather than generic ones when the text specifies the interaction type.>
  strain_relationships: <A semicolon-separated list of strain-species relationships, where each relationship connects a strain identifier to its parent taxon. CRITICAL: Use EXACTLY THE SAME strain identifiers as listed in the strains field above - copy them verbatim, character-for-character. Do not modify, abbreviate, or expand the strain identifiers. Each relationship should have the strain identifier, relationship type, and parent species/genus. For example: "DA-C8 type_strain_of Insulambacter thermoxylanivorax; MG1655 strain_of Escherichia coli; ATCC 25922 type_strain_of Klebsiella pneumoniae". The strain identifiers MUST be identical to those used in the strains and chemical_utilizations fields. If no strain relationships are found, leave this field empty. DO NOT write "none".>
  article_type: <The type of study or article. Choose the most appropriate category based on the content, with emphasis on metabolic_study for articles focusing on chemical utilization, degradation, or metabolic pathways.Must be one of: novel_species, novel_genus, taxonomic_revision, phylogenetic_analysis, comparative_taxonomy, emended_description, genome_sequence, review, biochemical_characterization, ecological_study, metabolic_study, physiology_study>
