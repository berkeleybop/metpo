Abstract
This review covers some recent advances in application of omics
technologies to studying methylotrophs, with special reference to
their activities in natural environments. Some of the developments
highlighted in this review are the new outlook at the role of the
XoxF-type, lanthanum-dependent methanol dehydrogenase in
natural habitats, new mechanistic details of methane oxidation
through the reverse methanogenesis pathway, propensity of
'aerobic' methanotrophs to thrive in hypoxic environments and
potential connection of this process to denitrification, and a novel
outlook at methane oxidation as a community function.
