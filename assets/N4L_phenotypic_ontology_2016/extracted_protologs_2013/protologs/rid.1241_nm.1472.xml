Cells may be capsulated. Cells are usually 0.5 to 1.0 by 1 to 4.5 μm in size. Older cells may become elongated and reach lengths of 10 μm or more. Some cells may have a swollen or bloated appearance. Cells occur singly or in pairs and may form rosettes in the center of which there may be a glistening corpuscle. Each rosette-forming cell has a simple mucilaginous holdfast at its non-reproductive pole, by which it attaches to other cells or to solid surfaces. No stalks, prosthecae, or other holdfast structures are present.</s></p><p class="description"><s>Reproduction occurs by asymmetric division (budding) of the mother cell to produce a shorter daughter cell or bud at the free pole of the mother cell.</s><s>Buds may be spherical, ovoid, or rod shaped and are usually 0.3 to 0.8 by 0.3 to 1μm in size.</s><s>The free bud cells may be nonmotile or motile with single polar flagella.</s></p><p class="description"><s>Chemoorganotrophic.</s><s>Good growth occurs on PYG medium or peptone-yeast extract agar.</s><s>Growth occurs on glucose-ammonium sulfate agar.</s><s>Methanol may be used by some strains as a source of carbon and energy.</s><s>One isolate is capable of autotrophic growth in an atmosphere containing</s></p><p class="description"><s>75% H<sub>2</sub>, 10% 0<sub>2</sub>, and 15% CO<sub>2</sub>.</s><s>No vitamin requirements.</s><s>Colony pigmentation is white or yellow.</s></p><p class="description"><s>Aerobic.</s><s>Catalase and oxidase positive.</s><s>Acid but no gas is produced from glucose.</s><s>Nitrate may be reduced.</s></p><p class="description"><s>The guanine-plus-cytosine content of the deoxyribonucleic acid ranges from 59 to 66 mol%.</s></p><p class="description"><s>Found in natural waters.</s></p><p class="description"><s>The type species is <i>Blastobacter henricii</i> Zavarzin 1961.</s><s>No type culture has been isolated.</s></p></content></protolog>
