title: METPO Chemical Utilization Extraction Template (Enhanced)
description: >-
  A focused OntoGPT template for extracting organism-chemical utilization relationships from bacterial literature. Uses a two-step approach: first identifies chemicals mentioned in text, then extracts specific utilization relationships with METPO interaction predicates. Enhanced version adds improved predicate selection guidance while maintaining the proven V1 structure.

      Extract chemical utilization relationships with consistent strain identification. CRITICAL: Use identical strain identifiers across strains, chemical_utilizations,  and strain_relationships fields. Extract clean strain designators (e.g., "DA-C8",  "MG1655") consistently throughout all fields.

        range: Strain
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            Extract ONLY the strain designation part (e.g., "DA-C8", "MG1655", "ATCC 25922") WITHOUT genus/species prefixes. Focus on strain numbers, culture collection codes, and isolate identifiers. Automatically remove terminal "T" or "(T)" suffixes as these indicate type strain status (e.g., "DA-C8T" becomes "DA-C8", "K13T" becomes "K13"). Include strain numbers, culture collection numbers, and isolate names, but NOT the full taxonomic context.
      chemicals_mentioned:
        description: >-
          List of chemical compounds mentioned in the text that could be involved in metabolic processes, growth, or biochemical reactions
        multivalued: true
        range: ChemicalCompound
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            Identify all chemical compounds mentioned in the text that are relevant to bacterial metabolism, growth, or biochemical activities. Include: carbon sources (glucose, acetate), nitrogen sources (ammonia, nitrate), vitamins (B12, biotin), metabolic intermediates, enzyme substrates, electron acceptors/donors, and any other chemicals involved in bacterial physiology. If no relevant chemicals are mentioned,  leave this field completely empty. DO NOT include entries like "None  explicitly mentioned" or similar phrases.
      chemical_utilizations:
        description: >-
          List of specific organism-chemical utilization relationships with their interaction types from METPO ontology
        multivalued: true
        range: ChemicalUtilization
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            For each chemical compound found in chemicals_mentioned field above, extract structured relationships linking specific STRAIN IDENTIFIERS to those chemical compounds. CRITICAL: Use EXACTLY THE SAME strain identifiers as listed in the strains field above - copy them verbatim, character-for-character (clean identifiers like "DA-C8", "MG1655", "ATCC 25922" WITHOUT genus/species prefixes). Generate tuples specifying the strain identifier, the chemical, and the interaction type. Look for explicit statements like "strain X ferments glucose", "isolate Y requires vitamin B12", "DA-C8 hydrolyzes starch", etc. The subject must be a strain identifier that appears in the strains field, NOT a full species name. IMPORTANT: Extract BOTH positive relationships (what strains CAN utilize/degrade/transform) AND negative relationships (what strains CANNOT use or do not utilize). Be comprehensive - include all relevant chemical utilization patterns mentioned in the text. If no chemical utilization relationships are found, leave this field completely empty.
      strain_relationships:
        description: >-
          semicolon-separated list of strain-species relationships found in the text
        multivalued: true
        range: StrainRelationship
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            A semicolon-separated list of strain-species relationships, where each relationship connects a strain identifier to its parent taxon. CRITICAL: Use EXACTLY THE SAME strain identifiers as listed in the strains field above - copy them verbatim, character-for-character. Do not modify, abbreviate, or expand the strain identifiers. Each relationship should have the strain identifier, relationship type, and parent species/genus. For example: "DA-C8 type_strain_of Insulambacter thermoxylanivorax; MG1655 strain_of Escherichia coli; ATCC 25922 type_strain_of Klebsiella pneumoniae". The strain identifiers MUST be identical to those used in the strains and chemical_utilizations fields. If no strain relationships are found, leave this field empty. DO NOT write "none".

            Select the MOST SPECIFIC predicate from the METPO ontology that matches the text. Prefer specific predicates over generic ones:
            
            GROWTH & UTILIZATION: uses_for_growth, uses_as_carbon_source, uses_as_nitrogen_source, uses_as_energy_source, requires_for_growth, uses_for_aerobic_growth, uses_for_anaerobic_growth
            
            METABOLIC TRANSFORMATIONS: degrades, catabolizes, oxidizes, reduces, ferments, hydrolyzes, mineralizes, synthesizes
            
            NEGATIVE (important - extract these!): does_not_use_for_growth, does_not_use_as_carbon_source, does_not_degrade, does_not_ferment, does_not_oxidize, does_not_reduce, and other does_not_* predicates
            
            OTHER: uses_in_other_way (only when no specific predicate fits - e.g., chemotaxis, tolerance, resistance)
            
            Always choose the most specific predicate that accurately describes the relationship.
