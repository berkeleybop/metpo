# Literature Mining Development Notes

Comprehensive developer reference covering template design principles, implementation phases, domain analysis, and detailed assessment results for the OntoGPT-based bacterial literature mining pipeline.

## Implementation Phases and Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Critical Blockers - COMPLETE
**Fix S/P/O CompoundExpression Parsing**

**Problem Identified:**
- LLM generates: `fatty_acid_relationships: AZM34c11T predominant_fatty_acid iso-C16:0; NBRC 106114T predominant_fatty_acid iso-C16:0`
- Expected structure:
  ```yaml
  fatty_acid_relationships:
    - subject: AZM34c11T
      predicate: predominant_fatty_acid
      object: iso-C16:0
  ```
- **Root Cause**: OntoGPT's S/P/O parsing expected different input format than semicolon-separated strings
- **Impact**: 0% relationship extraction across all templates despite good LLM output

**Resolution:** Template prompt modifications and OntoGPT configuration adjustments resolved relationship parsing issues.

### ✅ Phase 2: Unified Assessment System - COMPLETE  
**Create Unified Assessment Script**

**Implemented Features:**
- Template-informed extraction analysis
- All pipeline health metrics in one tool (`unified_assessment.py`)
- Integration with existing assessors
- Goal-aligned reporting (raw→parsing→grounding→relationships)

**Key Metrics Covered:**
- Raw LLM quality (field completion, entity density)
- Parsing quality (structured extraction success, relationship parsing)
- Grounding quality (ontology coverage, AUTO entity rates)
- Relationship quality (entity-to-relationship conversion)

### ✅ Phase 3: Template Specialization Analysis - COMPLETE
**Outstanding Specialization Results Achieved**

**Specialization Scores:**
| Template | Overall Score | Specificity | Exclusivity | Status |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Chemical Utilization** | **99.0/100** | 100.0% | 98.0% | Excellent ✅ |
| **Growth Conditions** | **97.0/100** | 100.0% | 93.9% | Excellent ✅ |
| **Biochemical** | **96.6/100** | 100.0% | 93.1% | Excellent ✅ |
| **Morphology** | **89.3/100** | 87.5% | 91.1% | Very Good ✅ |
| **Taxa** | **83.9/100** | 75.0% | 92.8% | Good ✅ |

**Overlap Analysis Results:**
- **Minimal Cross-Template Overlap**: Average <10%, primarily universal entities
- **Highest Overlaps (All Acceptable)**:
  - Biochemical ↔ Morphology: 13.1% (mostly strain/taxa sharing)
  - Taxa ↔ Growth Conditions: 9.6% (expected universal entities)
  - Morphology ↔ Chemical Utilization: 1.9% (minimal cross-contamination)

**Validation of Design Principles:**
- ✅ "Minimize duplication except for strains, taxa, pmids" - Confirmed
- ✅ "Maximize sensitivity and specificity" - Achieved
- ✅ Templates focused on stated domains - Validated

### ✅ Phase 4: Enhanced Quality Metrics - COMPLETE
**Domain-Specific Grounding Analysis**

**Domain Classification System:**
- **Fatty acids** → CHEBI mapping quality
- **Enzyme activities** → EC/GO coverage  
- **Growth conditions** → ENVO/PATO controlled vocabulary
- **Bacterial taxa** → NCBITaxon coverage
- **Chemical compounds** → CHEBI grounding
- **Cell morphology** → METPO/PATO/GO terms

**Cross-Template Consistency Analysis:**
- Same entities grounded identically across templates
- Template-specific grounding performance patterns identified
- Domain-specific optimization recommendations generated

## Template Design Philosophy and Analysis

### IJSEM Literature Knowledge Distribution

**Analysis of 100 IJSEM abstracts reveals knowledge hierarchy:**

**High Frequency Information (80-100% of abstracts):**
- Taxonomic classification & new species descriptions
- Isolation source & environmental context  
- Basic cell morphology (shape, Gram staining, motility, spore formation)
- Growth conditions (temperature, pH, salinity, oxygen requirements)
- Phylogenetic relationships (16S rRNA analysis, closest relatives)

**Medium Frequency Information (45-75% of abstracts):**
- Metabolic capabilities & substrate utilization
- Biochemical characteristics (enzyme activities, API tests)
- Fatty acid profiles & chemotaxonomy
- Ecological roles & environmental adaptations

**Lower Frequency Information (25% of abstracts):**
- Secondary metabolite production  
- Specialized enzyme activities
- Detailed lipid compositions

### Template Design Implications

**Current Template Strategy Validation:**
The existing template suite aligns well with IJSEM literature patterns:

1. **Taxa Template**: Targets high-frequency taxonomic information (100% coverage)
2. **Growth Conditions Template**: Covers high-frequency environmental parameters
3. **Morphology Template**: Addresses high-frequency morphological characteristics  
4. **Biochemical Template**: Captures medium-frequency enzyme and metabolic data
5. **Chemical Utilization Template**: Specialized for medium-frequency metabolic patterns

**Why Small, Focused Templates Succeed:**
- IJSEM abstracts primarily focus on taxonomic description rather than comprehensive profiling
- High error rates from comprehensive templates due to requesting inconsistently present information
- Focused templates match natural information distribution in literature

### Normalization Strategy and Implementation

**Problem**: Literature uses inconsistent units and terminology
- "35 degrees", "35°C", "35 Celsius" → Should normalize to "35°C"  
- "pH of 7", "pH=7.0", "neutral pH" → Should normalize to "pH 7.0"
- "halophilic", "3.5% salt", "seawater salinity" → Should normalize to "3.5% NaCl"

**Solution**: LLM normalization in extraction prompts
```yaml
temperature_conditions:
  annotations:
    prompt: >-
      Normalize temperatures to °C format. Examples: "37°C", "25-30°C", 
      "optimal 28°C". Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius if needed.
```

**Success Examples Achieved:**
- "25.5 and 30.0 degrees C" → "25.5-30.0°C" 
- "pH 6.8 to 7.0" → "pH 6.8-7.0"
- "up to 4 % NaCl (w/v)" → "up to 4% NaCl"

### Dynamic METPO Integration Architecture

**Chemical Utilization Sophistication:**
```yaml
ChemicalUtilization:
  attributes:
    taxon: {range: Taxon}
    chemical: {range: ChemicalCompound} 
    utilization_type: {range: ChemicalInteractionPropertyEnum}
```

**Dynamic Enum Population:**
- **60+ METPO predicates** dynamically injected via SPARQL query
- **Examples**: `uses_as_carbon_source`, `ferments`, `hydrolyzes`, `requires_for_growth`
- **ChEBI grounding**: Links chemicals to standardized identifiers
- **Success**: "urea-hydrolysing" → taxon=organism, chemical=CHEBI:16199, utilization_type=hydrolyzes

**SPARQL Query Pipeline:**
1. `intermediates/tsv/chem_interaction_props.tsv` - Generated from METPO via SPARQL
2. `intermediates/yaml/chem_interaction_props_enum.yaml` - Converted to LinkML enum format
3. `templates/chemical_utilization_populated.yaml` - Template with injected enum

## Database Integration Strategy Analysis

### Literature vs Database Complementarity Analysis

**BacDive Advantages (Structured, Curated Data):**

**Growth Media Prediction Strengths:**
- **Precise quantitative data**: "pH 6.5-8.0 optimal 7.2" vs literature's "neutral pH"
- **Standardized media compositions**: Exact formulations with concentrations
- **API biochemical panels**: Complete standardized test results (API 20E, 50CHac, etc.)
- **Chemical database integration**: ChEBI IDs for precise compound identification
- **Multiple media testing**: Growth performance ratings across different media
- **Concentration tolerances**: Precise salt, temperature, pH ranges with growth ratings

**Example BacDive Structure for Media Prediction:**
```json
{
  "culture_medium": {
    "name": "Marine Broth 2216", 
    "composition": "detailed formula",
    "growth_performance": "good"
  },
  "culture_temperature": {
    "temperature": "25-30°C",
    "growth": "optimal at 28°C"  
  },
  "metabolite_utilization": {
    "compound": "CHEBI:17234",
    "activity": "positive",
    "test_type": "API 50CHac"
  }
}
```

**Literature Extraction Advantages:**

**Coverage and Timeliness:**
- **Novel organisms**: New species before database curation
- **Experimental context**: Growth optimization studies and media development
- **Strain variations**: Specific isolate characteristics not in type strain databases
- **Recent research**: Latest cultivation methods and media innovations

**Example Literature Insights Not in BacDive:**
- "Requires vitamin B12 supplementation for optimal growth"
- "Growth enhanced by 0.1% yeast extract in minimal medium"
- "Adapted growth protocol using modified seawater medium"

### Predictive Modeling Framework

**Feature Engineering for Growth Media Prediction:**
- **API biochemical profiles** as metabolic fingerprints (BacDive)
- **Chemical utilization patterns** from METPO predicates (Literature)
- **Environmental parameter ranges** from both sources
- **Phylogenetic proximity** to organisms with known media requirements

**Media Recommendation Algorithm Design:**
1. **Baseline from phylogeny**: Start with media successful for closest relatives
2. **API pattern matching**: Identify organisms with similar biochemical capabilities  
3. **Chemical requirement overlay**: Add specific carbon/nitrogen sources from utilization data
4. **Environmental parameter adjustment**: Modify temperature, pH, salinity based on tolerance data
5. **Literature optimization**: Incorporate strain-specific requirements and novel additives

### Template Coverage Assessment for Media Prediction

| Requirement | Taxa | Phylogeny | Growth Conditions | BacDive Coverage |
|-------------|------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Organism ID | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Phylogenetic context | - | ✅ | - | ✅ |
| Culture media | - | - | ✅ | ✅ |  
| Temperature range | - | - | ✅ | ✅ |
| pH tolerance | - | - | ✅ | ✅ |
| Salt tolerance | - | - | ✅ | ✅ |
| Oxygen requirements | - | - | ✅ | ✅ |
| Chemical utilization | - | - | ✅ | ✅ |
| Growth requirements | - | - | ✅ | ✅ |
| API test results | - | - | - | ✅ |
| Quantitative precision | - | - | ± | ✅ |

**Gap Analysis Conclusion**: Literature templates provide qualitative/semi-quantitative data excellent for discovery, while BacDive provides quantitative precision essential for media formulation. Integration of both sources necessary for comprehensive media prediction systems.

## Infrastructure Evolution and Lessons Learned
