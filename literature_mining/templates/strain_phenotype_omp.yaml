title: METPO Strain Phenotype Extraction for ICBO 2025
description: >-
  OntoGPT template for ICBO 2025 demonstration showing METPO grounding
  strengths and weaknesses. Focuses on RDF-ready triples linking strains
  to species and phenotypes within METPO's domain.

            Extract strain designations WITHOUT genus/species prefixes.
            Remove terminal "T" or "(T)" suffixes indicating type strain status.
            Examples: "DSM 12345T" becomes "DSM 12345", "strain ABC" becomes "ABC".
      strain_to_taxon:

        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            Extract strain-to-species relationships using exactly the same strain
            identifiers from the strains field above. Connect each strain to its
            parent taxon.
      strain_to_phenotype:
        description: Relationships linking strains to phenotypic characteristics
        multivalued: true
        range: StrainToPhenotypeRelationship
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            Extract ALL strain-phenotype relationships mentioned in the text. Be COMPREHENSIVE - do not omit any phenotypes. Use EXACTLY the same strain identifiers from the strains field above.

            OUTPUT FORMAT: semicolon-separated on a single line. DO NOT use YAML list format with dashes (-).

            Example: 017 has_phenotype rod-shaped; 017 has_phenotype Gram-negative; 017 has_phenotype motile

            Extract phenotypes including: cell shape (rod-shaped, coccus-shaped, spiral, curved), Gram staining (Gram-positive, Gram-negative, Gram-stain-negative, Gram-variable), motility (motile, non-motile, flagellated), oxygen requirements (aerobic, anaerobic, facultatively_anaerobic, microaerophilic), temperature preferences (mesophilic, thermophilic, psychrophilic), pH preferences (acidophilic, alkaliphilic, neutrophilic), salinity tolerance (halophilic), and pigmentation colors.
      strain_to_medium:

        multivalued: true
        range: StrainToMediumRelationship
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            Extract ALL strain-medium relationships mentioned in the text. Use EXACTLY the same strain identifiers from the strains field above.

            For example: 017 grows_on_medium marine_agar_2216; MG1655 grows_on_medium LB; K12 requires_medium R2A; StrainXYZ grows_on_medium TSA

            Include standard media names (TSA, R2A, LB, nutrient agar, marine agar) and specific formulations mentioned.
