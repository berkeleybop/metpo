NIRS	Non-invasive Respiratory Support Ontology	Managing patients with respiratory failure increasingly involves non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS) as an alternative to traditional ventilation methods. However, despite the rapidly expanding use of NIRS, there is a significant challenge to its best use under all medical circumstances. It lacks a unified ontological structure, complicating guidance on NIRS modalities across healthcare systems. Our goal was to develop an NIRS ontology to support knowledge representation in acute care settings by providing a unified framework that enhances data clarity, interoperability, and clinical decision-making.

BCIO	Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology	The Human Behaviour Change Project (HBCP) funded by the Wellcome Trust, and the Advancing Prevention Research in Cancer through Ontology Tools (APRICOT) Project funded by the US National Institutes of Health, are developing the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology and associated tools and resources to be used in reporting research; linking datasets and synthesising evidence; and AI/machine learning algorithms to predict intervention outcomes in novel scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe overall aim of these projects is to automate evidence searching, synthesis and interpretation to rapidly address questions from policy-makers, practitioners and others to answer ‘What works, compared with what, how well, with what exposure, with what behaviours (for how long), for whom, in what settings and why?’. To achieve this, ontologies can help structure evidence, i.e., link evidence with a shared formal description of classes and relationships capturing domain knowledge in order to enable aggregation and semantic querying. We are developing and maintaining the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology (BCIO) to do this.	https://www.humanbehaviourchange.org/	Maya Braun	2025-07-09T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/mayabraun;https://data.bioontology.org/users/Janna+Hastings

O3	Operational Ontology for Oncology 	The Operational Ontology for Oncology is formalized, machine-readable knowledge representation that defines and standardizes the concepts, terms, value sets and relationships used in cancer care. O3 is an operational ontology, meaning that its format and content is optimized for clinical process implementation with current clinical data systems. It is formed through multi-professional society based, multi-institutional consensus formation with  physicians, physicists, informaticists and other domain experts in the context of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM). It is formed in collaboration with and has been endorse by multiple professional societies including American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), Canadian Association for Radiation Oncology (CARO) and the European Society for Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ESTRO).    Its primary purpose is to ensure semantic interoperability of comprehensive data sets from disparate sources like electronic health records (EHRs), lab systems, and research databases to be accurately aggregated and understood by different systems. This is particularly crucial for a complex and data-rich field like oncology.  \r\n\r\nO3 was first published in the article, Operational Ontology for Oncology (O3): A Professional Society-Based, Multistakeholder, Consensus-Driven Informatics Standard Supporting Clinical and Research Use of Real-World Data From Patients Treated for Cancer. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2023 Nov 1;117(3):533-550. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2023.05.033. Epub 2023 May 26. PMID: 37244628; PMCID: PMC10741247.\r\n\r\nThe home web site is at o3standard.net.

OCS	A Foundational Ontology for Computational Sociology	The history of computational sociology extends over the last 4.5 decades; its roots can perhaps be found in general systems theory and structural functionalism. Ontologies have been created in a wide range of subject areas and their number and application areas are dramatically growing. However, it can be considered quite well-founded to assume that no ontology has been created in the general sociological subject area so far. \r\n\r\nThe OCS (Ontology for Computational Sociology) mentioned in the title makes a modest attempt at this, hoping that true experts in the subject area will end the topic itself (creating and further developing sociological ontologies) interesting. Therefore, let us quote modestly the esteemed Basel mathematician Johann Bernoulli, Opera Omnia, 67, Tom. I.: "Problema novum ad cuius solutionem sociologi invitantur." Keywords Computational sociology; ontology; Java-based application. , The ontology contains 701 classes (BFO-2020: 36, domain: 665) describing essential concepts of sociology	https://www.edithlaszny.eu/	Dr. Edit Hlaszny	2025-10-14T18:11:29.000-07:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/edithlaszny

FISHO	Fish Ontology	This Fish Ontology is an ontology created as how the author views the fish structure following the book "The Diversity of Fishes: Biology, Evolution and Ecology" as the main reference, which covers one part of view on ichthyology, with an emphasis on diversity and adaptation. This ontology is created with the mindset of categorizing fish automatically based on the attributes and terms mined from the fish specimen.\r\n\r\nMost of the basic organization from this ontology follows Nelson's research due to its synthetic and broad approach, while recognizing that Nelson's conclusions are one of many alternative interpretations of the literature, which is mostly agreed by our main references, and many fish and fisheries researchers.\r\n\r\nMost of the classification used in this ontology is in no means completed and just following the recent classification provided by the books\r\n\r\nFor now our work focused more on two group of fish which is early jawless fish, and advanced jawed fishes. The classification from both of this group are structured following the reference.		Mohd Najib	2017-08-28T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/23.mohdnajib
SIMON	Simple Measurement Ontology	The SImple Measurement ONtology (SIMON) is a small vocabulary (3 top level classes: PunnedClass, Measurement, and Unit) to represent measurements and units. It uses the pattern to represent N-ary relations and a recursive structure to make the representation of various measurements and units (e.g., "5 kilograms", "4 miles per hour", "5 meters per second per second"  straight forward and obvious. It utilizes the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to automatically order measurements of the same type (e.g., Speed) regardles of units. E.g., that 5 kilometers per hour is greater than 5 meters per hour. It does this by transforming all measures of a specific type (e.g., distance, mass, speed, acceleration) to canonical units. The canonical units can be modified by changing a few rules. I also include on the github page some SPARQL transformations that generate the rdfs:label for each measurement instance so the developer doesn't have to take the effort and potential error prone risk of doing this manually.  The version included here is the version after the SWRL rules have run and with the inferences exported and also after the SPARQL transforms have generated all the rdfs:label values. Although there are other vocabularies that address this problem they are either much more complex (addressing many additional issues besides units and measures) and/or do not automatically order measures of different units. 	https://github.com/mdebellis/SIMON-A-Simple-Measurement-Vocabulary	Michael DeBellis	2021-05-07T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/mdebellis

SLSO	Space Life Sciences Ontology	The Space Life Sciences Ontology is an application ontology and is intended to support the operation of NASA's Life Sciences Data Archive (located at https://nlsp.nasa.gov) and other systems that contain space life science research data. Many kinds of scientific research in space involve specialized equipment, experimental procedures, specimens and specimen collection apparatus, supporting operational structures, and references to specific space environments and their characteristics. Often such research is extremely costly compared with planetary/terrestrial investigations, and the community supporting space life sciences is accustomed to the use of various specialized concepts and terminologies when dealing with this kind of research and data. However, the underlying conceptual models (and especially the specific labeled relationships in these models) have never been made explicit. The SLSO attempts to provide definition and organization of these models for the space research community.\r\nThe SLSO was developed ab inicio using the Ontology Development Kit and imports an extends many concepts from the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI), the Environmental Ontology (ENVO), and other OBO Foundry ontologies. Projects at NASA such as the Open Science Data Repository (https://osdr.nasa.gov/) are already using many OBO ontologies, including the Radiation Biology Ontology (https://github.com/Radiobiology-Informatics-Consortium/RBO) and OBI, to index space biology investigation data. With the development of the SLSO, this practice can be extended to include all life science research in space or addressing space effects. Furthermore, the SLSO has a component that imports concepts from the Science Data Discovery Ontology, which was developed to support NASA's Science Discovery Engine (https://sciencediscoveryengine.nasa.gov). These links in the imported SDDO to concepts underlying a broad spectrum of space research (astrophysics, heliophysics, etc.) can ultimately be used to provide key capabilities for discovering and analyzing space life science data and how they relate to other kinds of scientific data regarding space environments., The Space Life Sciences Ontology is an application ontology and is intended to support the operation of NASA's Life Sciences Data Archive and other systems that contain space life science research data.	https://github.com/nasa/LSDAO/tree/master/src/ontology	Dan Berrios	2025-09-16T18:13:57.000-07:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/danberrios

BIM	Biomedical Image Ontology	Biomedical images published within the scientific literature play a central role in reporting and facilitating life science discoveries. Existing ontologies and vocabularies describing biomedical images, particularly sequence images, do not provide sufficient semantic representation for image annotations generated automatically and/or semi-automatically. We present an open ontology for the annotation of biomedical images (BIM) scripted in OWL/RDF. The BIM ontology provides semantic vocabularies to describe the manually curated image annotations as well as annotations generated by online bioinformatics services using content extracted from images by the Semantic Enrichment of Biomedical Images (SEBI) system. The BIM ontology is represented in three parts; (i) image vocabularies - which holds vocabularies for the annotation of an image and/or region of interests (ROI) inside an image, as well as vocabularies to represent the pre and post processing states of an image, (ii) text entities - covers annotations from the text that are associated with an image (e.g. image captions) and provides semantic representation for NLP algorithm outputs, (iii) a provenance model  - that contributes towards the maintenance of annotation versioning. To illustrate the BIM ontology’s utility, we provide three annotation cases generated by BIM in conjunction with the SEBI image annotation engine.	https://sites.google.com/site/bimontology/	Mate Levente Nagy	2014-09-26T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/ahmadchan

AHSO	Animal Health Surveillance Ontology	(Work in progress - please contact ahso@datadrivensurveillance.org before using this ontology)\r\n\r\nThis is an ontology for health surveillance, assuming that surveillance data is recorded at three main levels:\r\n\r\nSAMPLE data - data about specific collected samples; OBSERVATIONS, which can aggregate several samples; and OBSERVATIONAL CONTEXT, which is the context in which the observations were made (for instance clinical observation, surveillance sampling, etc). \r\n\r\nHEALTH EVENT is the occurrence in the real World to be modeled. This occurrence is an abstract concept, as it generally cannot be determined what are its boundaries in time, space, or population units. \r\n\r\nWe assume that several OBSERVATIONS are derived from each health event, and recorded in the same or different databases - for instance clinical journal, laboratory database, abattoir. At the same time or not. \r\n\r\nAHSO attempts to model these time specific observations. The ontology is focused on the modeling of the animal and health information connected to a single observation, made at a specific point on time. All the information recorded is relative to that specific point in time.\r\n\r\nFor instance, an animal belongs to a herd, which belongs to an owner, AT THE TIME OF THE OBSERVATION. We do not attempt to model how that animal changed herds on time. Similarly, we do not model clinical progression. It is up to those using the data to create definitions of when two observations should be connected to the same event.	http://datadrivensurveillance.org/ahso	Karl Hammar	2018-07-30T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/datadrivendorea

TOP-MENELAS	Menelas Project Top-Level Ontology	The two main goals MENELAS contributes to are to (i) Provide better account of and better access to medical information through natural languages in order to help physicians in their daily practice, and to (ii) Enhance European cooperation by multilingual access to standardised medical nomenclatures. The major achievements of MENELAS are the realisation of its two functional systems: (i) The Document Indexing System encodes free text PDSs into both an internal representation (a set of Conceptual Graphs) and international nomenclature codes (ICD-9-CM). Instances of the Document Indexing System have been realised for French, English and Dutch ; (ii) The Consultation System allows users to access the information contained in PDSs previously indexed by the Document Indexing System. The test domain for the project was coronary diseases. The existing prototype shows promising results for information retrieval from natural language PDSs and for automatically encoding PDSs into an existing classification such as ICD-9-CM. A set of components, tools, knowledge bases and methods has also been produced by the project. These include language-independent ontology and models for the domain of coronary diseases; conceptual description of the relevant ICD-9-CM codes.\r\nThis ontology includes a top-ontology, a top-domain ontology and a domain ontology (Coronay diseases surgery). The menelas-top ontology here is the part of the whole ontology without any reference to medical domain.\r\n		Jean Charlet	2018-01-26T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/xaime;https://data.bioontology.org/users/Jean.Charlet

PSDO	Performance Summary Display Ontology	The Performance Summary Display Ontology (PSDO) is a lightweight application ontology used to reproducibly study visualizations of clinical performance and their associated outcomes in healthcare quality improvement settings. PSDO extends boundaries of visual representation artifacts by the IAO in the domain of distributed representations. PSDO describes dimensional representations of relational information displays that can be used to study the influence of feedback interventions on clinical practice., Performance Summary Display Ontology (PSDO) is an application ontology about motivating information in performance summaries and the visual and textual entities that are used to communicate about performance. Motivating information includes performance comparisons and changes that motivate improvement or sustainment, such as improvement towards a goal, loss of high performer status, or the presence of a performance gap. Visual and textual entities include charts, tables, and graphs that display performance information. PSDO's domain focus is healthcare organizations that use clinical quality dashboards and feedback interventions for healthcare professionals and teams. Performance information is commonly about the quality of care and health outcomes that have been derived from clinical data using performance measures (aka metrics, process indicators, quality measures, etc). PSDO uses Basic Formal Ontology as its upper level ontology. This work is supported by the NIH, National Library of Medicine (1K01LM012528-01, 1R01LM013894-01).\n\nLandis-Lewis Z, Stansbury C, Rincón J, Gross C.

DTO	Drug Target Ontology	Drug Target Ontology (DTO) is being developed at the University of Miami in the research group of Stephan Schürer. DTO is supported by grant U54CA189205 (Illuminating the Druggable Genome Knowledge Management Center, Tudor Oprea, PI) awarded by the NCI through the NIH Common Fund. It is a component of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project (https://commonfund.nih.gov/idg). The DTO project develops a novel semantic framework to formalize knowledge about drug targets with a focus on the current IDG protein families. The DTO is developed as a reference for drug targets with the longer-term goal to create a community standard that will facilitate the integration of diverse drug discovery information from numerous heterogeneous resources. The first version of the DTO consists of asserted class hierarchies of the four IDG protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels, and nuclear hormone receptors. Protein classes are linked to tissue and disease via different levels of confidence. DTO also contains drug target development level classifications developed in the IDG project (http://targetcentral.ws/), and functional and qualitative annotations and classifications for kinase proteins, GPCR ligands and ion channels. DTO is modeled in OWL2-DL to enable further classification by inference reasoning and SPARQL queries. DTO is implemented following a modularization approach. DTO is used as the organizational framework for drug targets in the IDG PHAROS User Interface Portal (https://pharos.nih.gov) and also the Tin-X Target Importance and Novelty Explorer (http://newdrugtargets.org).	http://drugtargetontology.org/	Stephan Schurer	2018-02-15T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/sschurer

ALLERGIDOC	Allergy Ontology	L'ontologie ALLERGIDOC représente la terminologie et les connaissances scientifiques, cliniques et généralistes du domaine de l'allergologie. Elle a été élaborée par Marcin Trzmielewski pour l'Unité d'Exploration des Allergies du CHU de Montpellier (référents : Docteur Davide Caimmi et Prof. Pascal Demoly), dans le cadre d'une thèse en sciences de l'information, de la communication et de la documentation à l'Université Paul Valéry Montpellier 3, financée par la Région Occitanie (France) entre 2019 et 2023 et encadrée par Prof. Céline Paganelli. L'ontologie a été élaborée dans une approche constructiviste, à partir d'une analyse des pratiques informationnelles des employés de l'unité d'allergologie et d'une analyse des documents que ces employés utilisent dans leur quotidien. \r\n\r\nLa version 3.0, élaborée après la thèse, comprend des modifications des versions 1.1 et 2.0 effectuées en février-mars 2025 par Marcin Trzmielewski (Laboratoire d'Etudes et de Recherches Appliquées en Sciences Sociales - LERASS), avec la contribution des étudiantes de la licence professionnelle en documentation : Anne Guerre, Nada Bouhsina, Sabrina Duc et Claire Casasso (Université de Montpellier Paul-Valéry). La version 3.0 contient également une nouvelle structuration au niveau des classes principales (facettes) et d'autres niveaux de profondeur classificatoire. L'analyse à facettes a été basée sur les catégories représentant les cibles informationnelles des professionnels d'allergologie et celles de la catégorie Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE). Les concepts, les termes et les relations qui composent l'ontologie sont issus des versions précédentes 1.1 et 2.0, des extractions terminologiques effectuées lors de l'élaboration de la version 1.0, comme des réunions de validation des versions 1.0 et 2.0. Ils proviennent également des systèmes d'organisation des connaissances existants : Ontology for General Medical Science, Information Artifact Ontology, MeSH, SNOMED, LOINC, Allergen Nomenclature, catalogues des allergènes ThermoFisher et Eurofins, site IMAIOS, taxonomies biologiques consultées sur Wikipédia, VIDAL, Gender, Sex, and Sexual Orientation Ontology, et classification d'Eckman.\r\nLa version 3.0 est actuellement en cours de validation par les professionnels d'allergologie.	https://allergo.infodocs.eu/ontologie/allergidoc3.0	Marcin Trzmielewski	2025-03-12T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/marcin.t

CCF	Human Reference Atlas Common Coordinate Framework Ontology	The Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) Ontology is an application ontology built to support the development of the Human Reference Atlas (HRA).  It unifies vocabulary for HRA construction and usage—making it possible to ingest external data sources; supporting uniform tissue sample registration that includes the spatial positioning and semantic annotations within 3D reference organs; and supporting user-formulated cross-domain queries over tissue donor properties, anatomical structures, cell types, biomarkers, and 3D space. The CCF Ontology consists of three major ontologies. The Biological Structure Ontology records anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers (ASCT+B) and the relationships between them.  The ASCT+B tables are authored by human experts using templated Google Sheets. The biomarkers, cell types, and anatomical structures are mapped to existing ontologies (Uberon/FMA, CL, HGNC) whenever possible.  All relationships between anatomical structures and from cell types to anatomical structures are valid Uberon and CL relationships. The Spatial Ontology defines the shape, size, location, and rotation of experimental tissue and data major anatomical structures in the 3D Reference Object Library. The Specimen Ontology captures the sex, age, and other information on donors that provided tissue data used in the construction of the HRA.	https://purl.humanatlas.io/vocab/ccf	Anita R.

SBO	Systems Biology Ontology	The Systems Biology Ontology is a set of controlled, relational vocabularies of terms commonly used in Systems Biology, and in particular in computational modeling. The ontology consists of six orthogonal vocabularies defining: the roles of reaction participants (eg. "substrate"), quantitative parameters (eg. "Michaelis constant"), a precise classification of mathematical expressions that describe the system (eg. "mass action rate law"), the modeling framework used (eg. "logical framework"), and a branch each to describe entity (eg. "macromolecule") and interaction (eg. "process") types, and a branch to define the different types of metadata that may be present within a model.\r\n\r\nSBO terms can be used to introduce a layer of semantic information into the standard description of a model, or to annotate the results of biochemical experiments in order to facilitate their efficient reuse.

BMS-LM	BioMedical Study Lifecycle Management	Biomedical research data reuse and sharing is essential for fostering research\r\nprogress. To this aim, data producers need to master data management and reporting\r\nthrough standard and rich metadata, as encouraged by open data initiatives such as\r\nthe FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines. This helps data re-users to understand and reuse the shared data with confidence. Therefore, dedicated frameworks are required. The provenance reporting throughout a biomedical study lifecycle has been proposed as a way to increase confidence in data while reusing it. The Biomedical Study - Lifecycle Management (BMS-LM) data model has implemented provenance and lifecycle traceability for several multimodal-imaging techniques but this is not enough for data understanding while reusing it. Actually, in the large scope of biomedical research, a multitude of metadata sources, also called Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs), are available for data annotation. In addition, data producers uses local terminologies or KOSs, containing vernacular\r\nterms for data reporting. The result is a set of heterogeneous KOSs (local and published) with different formats and levels of granularity. To manage the inherent heterogeneity, semantic interoperability is encouraged by the Research Data\r\nManagement (RDM) community. Ontologies, and more specifically top ontologies such as BFO and DOLCE, make explicit the metadata semantics and enhance semantic interoperability. Based on the BMS-LM data model and the BFO top ontology, the BioMedical Study - Lifecycle Management (BMS-LM) core ontology is proposed together with an associated framework for semantic interoperability between heterogeneous KOSs. It is made of four ontological levels: top/core/domain/local and\r\naims to build bridges between local and published KOSs. In this paper, the conversion of the BMS-LM data model to a core ontology is detailed. The implementation of its semantic interoperability in a specific domain context is explained and illustrated with examples from small animal preclinical research.

What is the total number of live births in the United States for a given year?\r\n\r\n2. What is the distribution of birth weight for babies born to mothers of different ages?\r\n\r\n3. What is the prevalence of preterm births among babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy?\r\n\r\n4. What is the relationship between maternal age and the likelihood of having a multiple birth?\r\n\r\n5. What is the difference in birth outcomes between mothers who receive prenatal care and those who do not?\r\n\r\n6. What is the trend in the rate of low birth weight babies over time?\r\n\r\n7. What is the impact of socioeconomic status on birth outcomes, such as birth weight and gestational age?\r\n\r\n8. What is the relationship between the mother's race and ethnicity and the likelihood of having a preterm birth?\r\n\r\n9. What are the common risk factors for adverse birth outcomes, and how do they interact with each other?\r\n\r\nUS Birth ontology can be used to facilitate data integration, analysis, and sharing across different data sources and systems. It can help to ensure that data is consistent, interoperable, and reusable, and can facilitate data discovery and reuse. The ontology can be used by researchers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers to ask and answer questions about birth outcomes, risk factors, and trends in the US birth data.	https://koolgax99.github.io/abhilash-US-birth-onto/index-en.html	Abhilash C B	2023-03-28T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/Abhilash+C+B

IDEM	IDEM: wInD Energy Models Taxonomy	Controlled vocabularies such as taxonomies allow an accurate and controlled approach in describing datasets. One of such controlled vocabulary is Wind Energy Taxonomy of Models. This taxonomy is the result of EERA JP WIND IRPWind Open Data initiative that took place in 2017 in which wind energy experts generated the first version of the taxonomy as an input for defining and structuring wind energy metadata.\r\n\r\nThe report of this work is available at Zenodo: https://www.zenodo.org/record/1199489#.XSD6haeQ3RY\r\n\r\nIn 2018, the taxonomy of topics was improved during the internal project of DTU Wind Energy titled 'FAIR Digitalization': https://www.zenodo.org/record/1493874#.XSD7TaeQ3RY\r\n\r\nIn 2021, the taxonomy was converted into FAIR machine-actionable controlled vocabulary using sheet2rdf. The controlled vocabulary is served to humans and machines using an instace of OntoStack hosted by DTU Wind Energy. sheet2rdf and OntoStack are developed by FAIR Data Collective.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in 2021, the persistent URL purl.org/idem has been registered for the taxonomy. This allows us to:\r\n\r\nIf there is a needed to move the taxonomy to another domain (currently under data.windenergy.dtu.dk) URLs will be still resolvable and unchanged\r\nUse short URls as PIDs for the taxonomy terms and properties.	https://github.com/DTUWindEnergy/IDEM-taxonomy	Nikola Vasiljevic	2021-10-05T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/niva

BAO	BioAssay Ontology	The BioAssay Ontology (BAO) describes chemical biology screening assays and their results including high-throughput screening (HTS) data for the purpose of categorizing assays and data analysis.  BAO is an extensible, knowledge-based, highly expressive (currently SHOIQ(D)) description of biological assays making use of descriptive logic based features of the Web Ontology Language (OWL).  BAO currently has over 1000 classes and also makes use of several other ontologies.  It describes several concepts related to biological screening, including Perturbagen, Format, Meta Target, Design,  Detection Technology, and Endpoint.  Perturbagens are perturbing agents that are screened in an assay; they are mostly small molecules. Assay Meta Target describes what is known about the biological system and / or its components interrogated in the assay (and influenced by the Perturbagen).  Meta target can be directly described as a molecular entity (e.g. a purified protein or a protein complex), or indirectly by a biological process or event (e.g. phosphorylation).  Format describes the biological or chemical features common to each test condition in the assay and includes biochemical, cell-based, organism-based, and variations thereof.  The assay Design describes the assay methodology and implementation of how the perturbation of the biological system is translated into a detectable signal.  Detection Technology relates to the physical method and technical details to detect and record a signal.  Endpoints are the final HTS results as they are usually published (such as IC50, percent inhibition, etc.).  BAO has been designed to accommodate multiplexed assays.  All main BAO components include multiple levels of sub-categories and specification classes, which are linked via object property relationships forming an expressive knowledge-based representation.

NERO	Named Entity Recognition Ontology 	Named Entity Recognition Ontology (NERO) developed specifically for describing textual entities in biomedical texts, which accounts for diverse levels of ambiguity, bridging the scientific sublanguages of molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and medicine. The annotation of natural science texts is more challenging than in other domains. Biomedical language is replete with ambiguity distinct from that observed in news articles or informal text online. In biomedical texts, alternative meanings are not always clearly separated.\r\n\r\nFor example, in some biomedical contexts, the words for a named entity may refer to a gene or a protein with nearly equal probability; for example, “a mutant hemoglobin α_2” can refer to either a gene or a protein. If the author meant gene-or-protein A, and we force an annotator to choose either interpretation gene A or protein A, the resulting annotation is of limited utility because the choice between gene and protein is random if the meanings are equally likely based on context. NERO attempts to minimize unwarranted, arbitrary annotative semantic label assignments for textual entities. \r\n\r\nNERO defines ambiguous concepts, such as GeneOrProtein, which subsumes both Gene and Protein using the following axiom: EquivalentTo: ‘Gene’ or ‘Protein.’ There are no biological entities that are either a gene or a protein, but there are lexical entities that can correspond to either or both of these entities.\r\n		Prof. Robert Stevens	2021-04-28T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/Larisa

NIST_GEL	NIST Genome Editing Lexicon	Genome editing technology is a fast-growing and rapidly advancing global bioscience field with applications in many biotechnology sectors. Genome editing is used to modify the nucleic acids of a genetic code, which can be composed of DNA or RNA, in a site-specific manner. Modifications can include insertion, deletion or alteration of nucleic acids. The technology operates by biochemical principles generally applicable to every kind of cell. Examples of genome editing technology applications with global significance include human cell-based therapeutics, agriculture, microbial based therapeutics, synthetic biology and biomanufacturing. While genome editing technology is being actively utilized, there is a need for international standardization in terms and definitions for this field, so as to enhance interpretation and communication of concepts, data and results. This document has been developed to provide a unified standard set of terms and definitions that serve the needs of biotechnology stakeholders and act as a reference for genome editing technology.	https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-genome-editing-lexicon	Sierra D.

EXO	Exposure Ontology	Significant progress has been made over the last several years in collecting and improving access to genomic, toxicology, and health data to promote understanding about environmental influences on human health. The resulting information resources, however, lack extensive and reliable exposure data, which are required to translate molecular insights, elucidate environmental contributions to diseases, and assess human health risks at the individual and population levels. We report our development of an Exposure Ontology, ExO, designed to address this information gap by facilitating centralization and integration of exposure data to inform understanding of environmental health. Like other widely used ontologies, ExO is intended to bridge the gap between exposure science and diverse environmental health disciplines including toxicology, epidemiology, disease surveillance, and epigenetics.	https://github.com/CTDbase/exposure-ontology	Anne Thessen	2025-09-09T09:05:46.000-07:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/graybeal

OFL	 A comprehensive ontology of flaps in reconstructive surgery	Introduction:\r\nThe diversity of flap types in plastic surgery has led to multiple classification systems based on factors such as blood supply, tissue composition and distance between donor and recipient site. However, no comprehensive framework exists that systematically integrates all relevant aspects. Capturing the full range of surgical flaps in a structured manner could facilitate future research, improve interoperability, and even optimize billing processes. Ontologies could address this gap. They offer a structured approach to organizing and formalizing knowledge by defining a hierarchical tree of classes and individuals linked logically to other entities. \r\nMaterials and Methods:\r\nWe applied principles of ontology engineering, integrating knowledge from surgical literature and clinical expertise to model a wide variety of flaps. These are linked to the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) ontology to describe their tissue components. The reasoner Hermit was employed to ensure logical consistency.\r\nResults:\r\nStructured hierarchically, the ontology links flaps to relevant anatomical structures and applies logical constraints to define necessary and sufficient conditions for each flap type. This enables precise representation of flap variations, each uniquely identified by an Ontology of Flaps in Reconstructive Surgery Identifier (OFLID). The developed ontology encompasses a wide range of local, pedicled, and free flaps. Simple local random-pattern V-Y flaps to complex chimeric and supercharged free flaps can be modelled and automatically classified. \r\nConclusions:\r\nThis ontology of surgical flaps could facilitate interoperability, multicentric research and artificial intelligence applications. Future work will focus on validation with larger datasets and expanding the ontology’s functionality.\r\n		Nico Franke	2025-09-25T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/Strubbelig

PW	Pathway Ontology	The goal of the Pathway Ontology is to cover all types of biological pathways, including altered and disease pathways, and to capture the relationships between them within the hierarchical structure of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The five nodes of the ontology are: classic metabolic, regulatory, signaling, drug and disease pathways. An extensive survey of the review literature along with searches of existing pathway databases have been used to choose terms and their position within the tree. The ontology is continually expanding along with the development of Pathway and Disease Portals at RGD. Mapping of pathways in other databases to terms in PW as synonyms further increased the content of the ontology. It also provided the means to bring in annotations made by these databases and link to their sites via automatic pipelines built at RGD. The ontology allows for the standardized annotation of rat as well as human and mouse genes to pathway terms. It also serves as a vehicle to connect between genes and ontology reports, between reports and interactive pathway diagrams, between pathways that directly connect to one another within a diagram or between pathways that in some fashion are globally related in pathway suites and suite networks. Metabolic, regulatory or signaling pathway terms have associated terms for the altered version of the pathway and the level at which the alteration(s) may occur. Proteins with mutations known to affect a particular pathway can be annotated to the normal and altered version(s) of the pathway and to a disease pathway, if known. Both the provision of terms for the altered versions of pathways and the representation of disease pathway diagrams as a collection of altered pathways are unique to the PW ontology and RGD's pathway data.\r\nThe Pathway ontology is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution license version 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0), see\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0 for details. 	https://rgd.mcw.edu/rgdweb/ontology/search.html	G.

PP	Pipeline Patterns Ontology	To answer the need for a workflow representing a sequence of data transformations, a high-level process ontology was defined, denoted Pipeline Patterns (PP) ontology. \r\n\r\nEvery concept is generically a Data (class from EDAM), which can be further specified as an Entry (P:00002) or an Exit (P:00009). All Entries can be subjected to an Operation (class from EDAM) producing an Intermediate (P:00010). An Intermediate has a TemporalEntity associated to represent its time of creation. Some Entries are specifically of the type Exit, meaning that they will represent concepts that exit the current category and be passed to the next one on the workflow. Additionally, in order to permit the treatment of a set of objects as a single entity, this high-level ontology considers the concept of List (P:00004) and more specifically an Aggregate (P:00005), containing a set of Data or Entry, respectively.\r\nThe concept Intermediate is an Entry, allowing for the successive application of an operation to an Element. This is particularly useful in the case of the application of sequential set of operations.	https://bitbucket.org/PlantExpAssay/ontology	PEAO Team	2014-12-17T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/ptgm;https://data.bioontology.org/users/cvaz
PR	Protein Ontology	PRO provides an ontological representation of protein-related entities by explicitly defining them and showing the relationships between them. Each PRO term represents a distinct class of entities (including specific modified forms, orthologous isoforms, and protein complexes) ranging from the taxon-neutral to the taxon-specific. The ontology has a meta-structure encompassing three areas: proteins based on evolutionary relatedness (ProEvo); protein forms produced from a given gene locus (ProForm); and protein-containing complexes (ProComp).	http://proconsortium.org	Darren Natale	2025-03-28T18:14:25.000-07:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/dan5%40georgetown.edu

PEAO	Plant Experimental Assay Ontology	The Plant domain has been the subject of several attempts to structure and formally define terms and corresponding relations, such as their anatomical features, developmental stages, and the application of particular experimental procedures to a biological problem. However, a focus on experimental assays in order to describe the whole experimental procedure, to the best of our knowledge, has only been attempted in the context of a very general description based on classical views of the scientific method. In this study, we focus on the development and proposal of an ontology dedicated to the description of these experimental procedures, regardless of the scientific questions that prompted the assays. This ontology includes entities from three distinct realms (biological, physical and data), which include both experimental products, their relations and the protocols describing their manipulation. The final outcome is a useful and comprehensive ontology in the plant domain, to be used as a log book by experimentalists, providing a formal relation between entities.	https://bitbucket.org/PlantExpAssay/ontology	PEAO Team	2019-02-08T18:09:31.000-08:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/ptgm;https://data.bioontology.org/users/cvaz

OBOE	The Extensible Observation Ontology	The Extensible Observation Ontology (OBOE) is a formal ontology for capturing the semantics of scientific observation and measurement. The ontology supports researchers to add detailed semantic annotations to scientific data, thereby clarifying the inherent meaning of scientific observations. The main concepts in OBOE include:\r\n\r\n- Observation: an event in which one or more measurements are taken\r\n- Measurement: the measured value of a property for a specific object or phenomenon (e.g., 3.2)\r\n- Entity: an object or phenomenon on which measurements are made (e.g., Quercus rubrum)\r\n- Characteristic: the property being measured (e.g., VolumetricDensity)\r\n- Standard: units and controlled vocabularies for interpreting measured values (e.g., g/cm^3)\r\n- Protocol: the procedures followed to obtain measurements (e.g., DensityProtocol2014)\r\n\r\nOBOE can characterize the context of an observation (e.g., space and time), as well as dependencies such as nested experimental observations. It includes an extensive set of unit definitions (e.g., grams of carbon per liter of seawater), and can facilitate automatic unit conversions (e.g., pounds to kilograms). OBOE can be easily extended to create Entities and Characteristics for specific research domains, making it both broadly applicable and highly customizable.\r\n\r\nOBOE is being used to improve data interpretation, facilitate reuse, and create precise and effective systems for data search and discovery.	https://github.com/NCEAS/oboe	Bryce Mecum	2019-09-17T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/brycemecum

EHDAA	Human Developmental Anatomy Ontology, abstract version 1	A structured controlled vocabulary of stage-specific anatomical structures of the human. It has been designed to mesh with the mouse anatomy and incorporates each Carnegie stage of development (CS1-20). The abstract version of the human developmental anatomy ontology compresses all the tissues present over Carnegie stages 1-20 into a single hierarchy. The heart, for example, is present from Carnegie Stage 9 onwards and is thus represented by 12 EHDA IDs (one for each stage). In the abstract mouse, it has a single ID so that the abstract term given as just <i>heart</i> really means <i>heart (CS 9-20)</i>.

EHDAA2	Human Developmental Anatomy Ontology, abstract version 2	A structured controlled vocabulary of stage-specific anatomical structures of the human. It has been designed to mesh with the mouse anatomy and incorporates each Carnegie stage of development (CS1-20). The abstract version of the human developmental anatomy ontology compresses all the tissues present over Carnegie stages 1-20 into a single hierarchy. The heart, for example, is present from Carnegie Stage 9 onwards and is thus represented by 12 EHDA IDs (one for each stage). In the abstract mouse, it has a single ID so that the abstract term given as just <i>heart</i> really means <i>heart (CS 9-20)</i>. Timing details will be added to the abstract version of the ontology in a future release.	http://genex.hgu.mrc.ac.uk/	EMAP Administrators	2024-01-11T18:05:36.000-08:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/J.Bard%40ed.ac.uk
SSBD	SSBD Ontology	SSBD Ontology is a two-tier model for FAIR metadata of bioimaging.\r\nThe repository layer captures the minimum information required for rapid, DOI-based release of image datasets, while the added-value layer enriches the same instances with detailed biological context (organism, strain, cell/cell-line, anatomy, GO terms) and imaging provenance (imaging method, instrument, OME-Zarr links).\r\nSSBD Ontology re-uses and aligns with OBO Foundry ontologies— ChEBI, CL, CLO, UBERON, GO, FBbi, OBI, IAO—so that multi scale data information can be integrated uniformly.\r\nThe ontology is distributed under CC-BY 4.0., The SSBD Ontology is an ontology of SSBD (https://ssbd.riken.jp).\r\nSSBD is a platform for sharing and reusing bioimaging data. SSBD:database is an added-value database for bioimages and biological dynamics data. It provides a rich set of open resources for analyzing microscopy images and qunatitative data of biological objects, such as single-molecule, cell, tissue, individual, etc., and software tools for analysis. Microscopy images and quantitative biological data are collected from a variety of species, sources, and methods. These include data obtained from both experiments and computational simulations.	https://github.com/openssbd/ssbd-ontology	Yuki Yamagata	2025-07-23T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/yukiyama

DRMO	Dental Restorative Material Ontology	The DrMO ontology is a domain ontology that represents knowledge underlying the composition, characterization and standardization of different materials involved in the dental restoration procedure. It will assist dentists in selecting appropriate materials based on up-to-date scientific knowledge to satisfy a patient’s specific requirements, without jeopardizing their clinical time. It reuses several ontologies from the OBO foundry, especially the Oral Health and Disease (OHD) Ontology. However, the dental restoration domain is complex and also requires concepts from materials science and engineering. Thus, DrMO also incorporates knowledge from the Devices, Experimental scaffolds, and Biomaterials (DEB) and Functionally Graded Materials (FGM) ontologies to provide more comprehensive knowledge of this area of dental material than previous ontologies. However, much of the terminology from FGM is different than that used in clinical dentistry. Thus, DrMO has changed the appropriate classes to make them consistent with terminology common in dentistry.  DrMO also follows ontology design best practices by reusing meta-data properties from the Dublin Core vocabulary. It captures knowledge from a large set of the most recent and influential papers in Dental Materials and related fields. Links to these papers are included in the ontology as meta-data defined with Dublin Core. It is implemented in OWL2 and was developed with the Protégé 5.5 ontology editor.  The ontology was created using the Ontology Development 101 methodology by Natalya et.al. Several domain experts in addition to Dr. Dutta also provided their expertise. The ontology is available on GitHub and licensed via an open source license. The GitHub project includes a corresponding file of SPARQL queries that answer the competency questions defined as part of the ontology development methodology.

NIFDYS	Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) Dysfunction Ontlogy	This ontology contains the former BIRNLex-Disease, version 1.3.2. -- The BIRN Project lexicon will provide entities for data and database annotation for the BIRN project, covering anatomy, disease, data collection, project management and experimental design.  It is built using the organizational framework provided by the foundational Basic Formal Ontology (BFO).  It uses an abstract biomedical layer on top of that - OBO-UBO which has been constructed  as a proposal to the OBO Foundry.  This is meant to support creating a sharable view of core biomedical objects such as biomaterial_entity, and organismal_entity that all biomedical ontologies are likely to need and want to use with the same intended meaning.  The BIRNLex biomaterial entities have already been factored to separately maintained ontology - BIRNLexBiomaterialEntity.owl which this BIRNLex-Main.owl file imports.  The Ontology of Biomedical Investigation (OBI) is also imported and forms the foundation for the formal description of all experiment-related artifacts.  The BIRNLex will serve as the basis for construction of a formal ontology for the multiscale investigation of neurological disease.	http://neuinfo.org/	Fahim Imam	2018-04-11T18:08:58.000-07:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/smtifahim%40gmail.com
DATAHUB	RADx Data Hub Ontology	The RADx Data Hub Ontology provides a formally structured vocabulary to describe key concepts within the RADx Data Hub. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of the ontology is to:\r\n\r\n1) Document key terms used in the Data Hub\r\nThe ontology lists and organizes the main types of entities and relationships that are relevant to the RADx Data Hub. This helps ensure that core terms are recorded in a consistent and reusable way.\r\n\r\n2) Clarify the meaning of those terms\r\nEach term is defined to reduce confusion and make its intended meaning clear to both technical and non-technical users. This helps support consistent use across teams and tools.\r\n\r\n3) Provide synonyms and alternate labels to support consistent usage\r\nThe ontology includes common synonyms or alternative names for terms to account for variation in how different groups of users refer to the same thing. This supports alignment across documentation, user interfaces, and data submission processes.\r\n\r\n4) Maintain a glossary of acronyms commonly used in RADx\r\nFrequently used acronyms are included as part of the ontology, linked to their full forms and definitions. This helps reduce ambiguity and supports clearer communication across documentation, interfaces, and stakeholder groups.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis shared vocabulary, that is provided and defined by the ontology, serves as the source of truth for terminology used across metadata records, user interfaces, documentation, and program communications.\r\n		Matthew Horridge	2025-03-25T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/mhorridge

ISSVA	International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) Ontology	The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) is a multidisciplinary international society of physicians, scientists, and health care providers united by an interest in vascular anomalies. The Society aims to promote the highest standards of care for patients with vascular anomalies by advancing clinical and scientific knowledge concerning causes, diagnosis and treatment, and by education of physicians, health care providers, patients and the community. The Society encourages the free flow of information between its members and interested groups, through workshop meetings and teaching programs, and by the dissemination of a classification scheme and pertinent scientific data.\r\n\r\nThe updated classification was approved at the May, 2018 General Assembly in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and can be found at https://www.issva.org/classification.\r\n\r\nWhat is the ISSVA Ontology?\r\n\r\nThe ISSVA ontology has been created to represent a sharable semantic data model of the ISSVA classification. This ontological representation of the ISSVA classification is machine-readable and facilitates interoperability between systems that capture data about vascular anomalies. It is structured hierarchically and contains all concepts of the ISSVA classification and the relationships between them. The ontology is available in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) format, and can be browsed and downloaded online: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ISSVA\r\n\r\nHow to Use the ISSVA Ontology?\r\n\r\nThe ISSVA ontology does not substitute the ISSVA classification, instead, it should be used as an additional component to facilitate interoperability. Every concept in the ISSVA ontology has a unique code that should be attached to the corresponding data element. In the context of databases, the ISSVA ontology codes could be added as an extra column to the existing data. \r\n\r\nMappings to Other Ontologies?\r\n\r\nThe ISSVA ontology contains machine-readable mappings to equivalent concepts in other ontologies, namely: the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO), SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), National Cancer Institute thesaurus (NCIT), and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). This means that data annotated with codes from the ISSVA ontology are interoperable with data annotated with the aforementioned ontologies, without any extra effort, as long as there exists a mapping between the concepts.\r\n\r\nIssue Reporting\r\n\r\nPlease contact ISSVA at info@issva.org in case you have any issues and/or feature requests for the ISSVA ontology. The ontology can then be updated accordingly.	https://www.issva.org	The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies	2021-02-19T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/mgkersloot;https://data.bioontology.org/users/philipvd;https://data.bioontology.org/users/svbruna

SCO	Study Cohort Ontology	The Study Cohort Ontology (SCO) is developed to model overall structure and patterns of cohort variables and control/intervention groups defined within the structured population descriptions (commonly referred to as Table1's or Cohort Summary Tables)of observational case studies and clinical trials. We maintain only domain agnostic and commonly occuring subject variables and interventions in SCO, and we have a suite of ontologies (Diseases, Medications, LabResults etc) to encode Diabetes related terminology. We have adopted a bottom-up approach to modeling and we have revised the structure of SCO upon investigation of a few research studies (11 to be precise) from the Pharmacological Interventions (Chapter 8) and Cardiovascular Complications (Chapter 9) of the American Diabetes Association (ADA)’s Standards of Medical Care 2018 CPG. We enable deep drive visualizations driven off queries to knowledge graphs modeled on SCO, to help assist physician visualize the similarity of a patient to a study group, at a quick glance. We welcome contributions and suggestions to extend SCO to represent cohort descriptions of publications targeted to other diseases, and we plan to release set of tools to make this process seamless.	https://tetherless-world.github.io/study-cohort-ontology/	Shruthi Chari	2019-04-18T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/oshani;https://data.bioontology.org/users/shruthichari

HSCLO38	Homo sapiens Chromosomal Location Ontology for GRCh38	HSCLO38's purpose is to simplify the integration of genomic experimental data at different resolution scales within biomedical knowledge graphs. It defines chromosomal locations within the GRCh38 release for chr 1-22, X,Y and M.  HSCLO38 provides 3,431,153 classes at five distinct resolution levels: whole chromosome, 1 megabase pair (Mbp), 100 kilobase pairs (kbp), 10 kbp, and 1 kbp.  Each node within these class levels is interconnected to its scale parent and to the immediate neighbors on either side to support mapping and association between genomic datasets and features. For example, the 1kbp element HSCLO38:chr1.20517001-20518000 is_a connected to its "scale parent" HSCLO38:chr1.20510001-20520000 as well as to the 5' neighbor HSCLO38:chr1.20516001-20517000 and 3' neighbor HSCLO38:chr1.20518001-20519000.

LCGFT	Library of Congress Genre/Form Thesaurus for Library and Archival Materials	The Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials (LCGFT) is a thesaurus that describes what a work is versus what it is about. For instance, the subject heading Horror films, with appropriate subdivisions, would be assigned to a book about horror films. A cataloger assigning headings to the movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre would also use Horror films, but it would be a genre/form term since the movie is a horror film, not a movie about horror films. The thesaurus combines both genres and forms. Form is defined as a characteristic of works with a particular format and/or purpose. A "short" is a particular form, for example, as is "animation." Genre refers to categories of works that are characterized by similar plots, themes, settings, situations, and characters. Examples of genres are westerns and thrillers. In the term Horror films"horror" is the genre and "films" is the form.	http://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms.html	Nancy Lorimer	2017-09-05T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/mdorf;https://data.bioontology.org/users/nlorimer

HUPSON	Human Physiology Simulation Ontology	Large biomedical simulation initiatives, such as the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH), are substantially dependent on controlled vocabularies to facilitate the exchange of information, of data and of models. Hindering these initiatives is a lack of a comprehensive ontology that covers the essential concepts of the simulation domain. \r\nWe propose a first version of a newly constructed ontology, HuPSON, as a basis for shared semantics and interoperability of simulations, of models, of algorithms and of other resources in this domain. The ontology is based on the Basic Formal Ontology, and adheres to the MIREOT principles.	http://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/en/business-research-areas/bioinformatics/downloads.html	Michaela Guendel	2014-04-08T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/akodamullil;https://data.bioontology.org/users/maestro

I-ADOPT	I-ADOPT Framework Ontology	The I-ADOPT Framework is an ontology designed to facilitate interoperability between existing variable description models (including ontologies, taxonomy, and structured controlled vocabularies). One of the challenges in representing semantic descriptions of variables is getting people to agree about what they mean when describing the components that define the variables. The I-ADOPT ontology addresses this by providing core components and their relations that can be applied to define machine-interpretable variable descriptions that re-use FAIR vocabulary terms. This first version of the ontology has been developed by a core group of terminology experts and users from the Research Data Alliance (RDA) InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology (I-ADOPT) Working Group.	https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/interoperable-descriptions-observable-property-terminology-wg-i-adopt-wg/wiki/i-adopt-0	Barbara Magagna	2025-05-28T18:06:36.000-07:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/mabablue
HTN	Hypertension Ontology	The Hypertension Ontology is a realism-based reference ontology for semantically managing clinical data about hypertension. Definitions of hypertension and elevated blood pressure are highly sensitive to context. Thresholds may vary according to population, guidelines, or clinical context. Variations in the clinical interpretation of blood pressure pose challenges to using blood pressure data for cohort identification, semantic data integration across data sets, and semantically enriching clinical data for clinical decision support applications. The Hypertension Ontology provides a framework for connecting clinical data to context-sensitive definitions of elevated blood pressure and hypertension.	https://github.com/aellenhicks/htn_owl	Amanda Hicks	2019-05-20T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/vendetti

CHEAR	Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource	Children's health and wellbeing are influenced by interactions between environmental and genetic factors. NIEHS is establishing an infrastructure, the Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource (CHEAR), to provide the extramural research community access to laboratory and data analyses that add or expand the inclusion of environmental exposures in children's health research. The goal of CHEAR is to provide tools so researchers can assess the full range of environmental exposures which may affect children's health. We anticipate that CHEAR will be used by children's health researchers conducting epidemiological or clinical studies that currently have limited consideration of environmental exposures, or those who have collected exposure data but seek more extensive analyses.

In order to bridge the gap between the overflow of HTS data and the bottleneck of integrated analysis tools, herein, we provide the first comprehensive GPCR ontology. The development and utility of GPCR ontology was based on previously developed BioAssay Ontology (BAO). The GPCR ontology contains information about biochemical, pharmacological, and functional properties of individual GPCRs as well as GPCR-selective ligands inclusive of their HTS screening results and other records. This provides the first all-inclusive GPCR ontology with all available data to model the relationship between the GPCR binding sites and their physiologic and pharmacologic role in physiology via small molecule chemical structures. We developed this system using emerging semantic technologies, by leveraging existing and descriptive domain level ontologies.	http://www.bioassayontology.org/	Stephan Schurer	2013-10-28T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/sschurer

ORDO	Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology	The Orphanet Rare Disease ontology (ORDO) is jointly developed by Orphanet and the EBI to provide a structured vocabulary for rare diseases capturing relationships between diseases, genes and other relevant features which will form a useful resource for the computational analysis of rare diseases. \r\n\r\nIt derived from the Orphanet database (www.orpha.net <http://www.orpha.net>) , a multilingual database dedicated to rare diseases populated from literature and validated by international experts. It integrates a nosology (classification of rare diseases), relationships (gene-disease relations, epiemological data) and connections with other terminologies (MeSH, SNOMED CT, UMLS, MedDRA),databases (OMIM, UniProtKB, HGNC, ensembl, Reactome, IUPHAR, Geantlas) or classifications (ICD10). \r\n\r\nThe ontology will be maintained by Orphanet and further populated with new data. Orphanet classifications can be browsed in the OLS view.\r\n\r\nThe Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology is updated twice a year and follows the OBO guidelines on deprecation of terms. It constitutes the official ontology of rare diseases produced and maintained by Orphanet (INSERM, US14). 	https://sciences.orphadata.com/ordo/	Ana Rath	2013-06-20T12:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/ORDO_Orphanet

ABD	Anthology of Biosurveillance Diseases	Our disease ontology provides information on infectious diseases, disease synonyms, transmission pathways, disease agents, affected populations and disease properties. Diseases have been grouped into syndromic disease categories, such that programmers can look through relevant categories, as well as at specific diseases. Organisms, linked to both agents and populations, are structured hierarchically, to provide multiple levels of organism resolution. In addition, both disease transmission and relevant disease properties are available to search. Disease properties include tags like 'notifiable diseases' and 'economic importance' to flag particular disease characteristics that may be of interest, but are not captured elsewhere.	http://brd.bsvgateway.org/disease	Ashlynn Daughton	2016-09-13T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/adaughton

NCCNEHR	NCCN EHR Oncology Categories	The NCCN EHR Oncology Advisory Group was formed to address the high variance in oncology history documentation within EHR systems. Specifically, there is a lack of standardization in the names of oncology history categories across institutions. Moreover, no synonym list or mapping currently exists between the varied category names. Furthermore, oncology history documentation is often inconsistent, incomplete, and not updated appropriately. The NCCN EHR Oncology Advisory Group has established best practices and is working with EHR vendors to implement and enhance tools for documentation of oncology history. This ontology is a result of the work of the group, and provides users with a list of oncology history categories and synonyms. It is our sincere hope that this work can form the basis of improving standardization and interoperability of oncology history documentation within EHR systems.	https://www.nccn.org/	Peter Lamb	2017-10-11T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/plamb86

BFO	Basic Formal Ontology	BFO grows out of a philosophical orientation which overlaps with that of DOLCE and SUMO. Unlike these, however, it is narrowly focused on the task of providing a genuine upper ontology which can be used in support of domain ontologies developed for scientific research, as for example in biomedicine within the framework of the OBO Foundry. Thus BFO does not contain physical, chemical, biological or other terms which would properly fall within the special sciences domains.	http://www.ifomis.org/bfo	Barry Smith	2015-08-29T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/jzheng;https://data.bioontology.org/users/BS

ICECI	International Classification of  External Causes of Injuries	The International Classification of External Causes of Injury (ICECI) is a system of classifications to enable systematic description of how injuries occur. It is designed especially to assist injury prevention. \r\n\r\nThe ICECI was originally designed for use in settings in which information is recorded in a way that allows statistical reporting--for example, injury surveillance based on collection of information about cases attending a sample of hospital emergency departments. It has also been found useful for other purposes. For example, it has been used as a reference classification during revision of another classification, to record risk-factor exposure of children in a cohort study, as the basis for special-purpose classifications and in a growing number of other ways.

IMGT-ONTOLOGY	Immunogenetics Ontology	IMGT-ONTOLOGY is the first ontology for immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. It provides a semantic specification of the terms to be used in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics and manages the related knowledge, thus allowing the standardization for immunogenetics data from genome, proteome, genetics, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures.  \r\nIMGT-ONTOLOGY manages the knowledge through diverse facets relying on seven axioms, "IDENTIFICATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "DESCRIPTION", "NUMEROTATION", "LOCALIZATION", "ORIENTATION" and "OBTENTION". These axioms postulate that any object, any process and any relation can be identified, classified, described, numbered, localized and orientated, and the way it is obtained can be characterized. The axioms constitute the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY, also designated as IMGT-Kaleidoscope. As the same axioms can be used to generate concepts for multi-scale level approaches, the Formal IMGT-ONTOLOGY represents a paradigm for system biology ontologies, which need to identify, to classify, to describe, to number, to localize and to orientate objects, processes and relations at the molecule, cell, tissue, organ, organism or population levels.\r\nIMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®, has been built on IMGT-ONTOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThe version 1.0.3 of IMGT-ONTOLOGY includes the concepts of IDENTIFICATION and an update of the concepts of CLASSIFICATION.	http://www.imgt.org/	Véronique Giudicelli, Patrice Duroux, Professor Marie-Paule Lefranc	2019-07-22T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/giudi

SNPO	Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Ontology	SNP-Ontology is a domain ontology that provides a formal representation (OWL-DL) of genomic variations. Despite its name, SNP-Ontology, is not limited to the representation of SNPs but it encompasses genomic variations in a broader meaning. SNP-Ontology is general enough to enable the representation of variations observed in genome of various species. Latest versions of SNP-Ontology include the representation of haplotype and of CNV. The unambiguous representation of genomic variations provided by SNP-Ontology enables to integrate heterogeneous data related to genomic variations. To achieve this goal SNP-Ontology enables (1) to represent one variation in accordance with various ways that exist for describing it, (2) to represent the equivalence between two distinct descriptions of one variation, and (3) to represent correspondence between a genomic variation and its outcome at the transcriptome and proteome levels.

THREE-ST	3-Step Theory of suicide	This ontology contains classes, sub-classes, and relationships that map onto the 3-Step Theory of suicide (3ST). The classes represent the four factors that make up the central tenets of the theory: 1) psychological pain, 2) hopelessness, 3) connectedness, and 4) capacity for suicide. The instances of each subclass are terms that were found in VA clinical notes and indicate presence or absence of the associated 3ST factor. The terms are intended to be used in an NLP pipeline to extract 3ST information from clinical progress notes.\r\nPsychological pain, hopelessness, and capacity for suicide are major risk factors for suicide, whereas connectedness is a protective factor. In brief, the theory holds that suicide only occurs if pain and hopelessness outweigh connectedness and only then if the capacity for suicide is present.

CODO	CODO: an Ontology for collection and analysis of COviD-19 data	The initial version, CODO ontology v1.0 to v1.3, encompasses pivotal features such as classes like patients, clinical findings, symptoms, and properties like relationships between patients, travel history, and test results. It facilitates tracking specific pandemic cases, detailing how patients may have been infected, and identifying potential contacts at risk due to their connection with the infected individual. CODO also enables monitoring of clinical tests, travel history, available resources, and actual needs like ICU beds and invasive ventilators. With capabilities for advanced analytics, contact tracing, trend studies, and growth projections based on daily COVID-19 data, CODO supports the organization and representation of COVID-19 data on a daily basis. It allows semantic querying and data retrieval and aids in behavior analysis of the disease and transmission routes.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Version 1.4, also known as CODO_COVIDRO 1.4 or COVID-19 Drug and Risk Ontology (COViDRO), presents a formal model specifically designed to tackle the multifaceted challenges associated with COVID-19 treatment, risk factors, and drug interactions. The knowledge embedded in the COViDRO model is extracted from diverse medical literature and treatment guidelines provided by reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The model incorporates information on therapeutics, adverse effects, and drug interactions from authoritative medical literature, making a significant contribution to patient care, research, and public health strategies.\r\n\r\nCOViDRO, or COVID-19 Drug and Risk Ontology 1.4, seamlessly integrates into knowledge graph information systems or recommender systems. It assists healthcare professionals in suggesting appropriate treatments by considering a comprehensive set of factors, abbreviated as "PRADiCT" (Patient Risk factors, Adverse effects, Drug interaction, Clinical findings, and Treatment procedure). These factors encompass patient risk level, risk factors (such as underlying health conditions, age, immunocompromised state, and occupation), drug interactions, drug adverse effects, clinical findings (including diagnosis, signs, symptoms, and status), and treatment procedures.\r\n\r\nBy offering a standardized framework for organizing and integrating data from diverse sources like clinical trials, medical literature, and real-world patient data, COViDRO enhances informed decision-making, thereby elevating the quality of patient care. It stands as a patient-centric solution, facilitating COVID-19 treatment options and personalized care based on individual patient characteristics. \r\n\r\nCODO V1.5 extends the previous CODO V1.4 with the focus on COVID-19 Virus Genomics for representation of genomic sequence data. VGO model comprises 261 classes, 55 object properties, and 14 data properties. Designed to streamline the use and dissemination of COVID-19 genomic sequence data, VGO serves as a robust resource for researchers and healthcare professionals. It incorporates data from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), which facilitates efficient querying and visualization of genomic data, thereby improving both accessibility and usability. VGO includes a variety of classes that represent COVID-19-related data such as variants, mutations, amino acids, genes, proteins, genome sequencing, samples, hosts, sampling strategies, and assembly methods. Furthermore, VGO supports automated reasoning, enhancing its functionality for in-depth analysis and interpretation. By integrating GISAID data into the VGO knowledge graph, the model not only enriches its conceptual representation but also optimizes the querying and visualization processes, making genomic data more accessible and usable for the scientific and medical communities.	https://github.com/biswanathdutta/CODO	Dutta, Biswanath 	2023-07-26T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/biswanathdutta
HSPO	Health and Social Person-centric Ontology	The HSPO is an ontology that aims to represent and link together information about an individual from multiple domains. This work is motivated by the need to better understand the drivers of health outcomes that may arise from other domains including, but not limited to, the social determinants of health (e.g. ethnicity, transportation, education). This ontology can also describe a group of individuals that share similar characteristics (i.e. a cohort). Through this ontology we attempt to define a number of social contexts or social domains which can be useful to organise information coming from different terminologies such as ICD and SNOMED. \r\n\r\nGit Repository, Documentation and License details: https://github.com/IBM/hspo-ontology\r\nApache License 2.0	https://github.com/IBM/hspo-ontology	HSPO Team https://github.com/IBM/hspo-ontology	2023-05-25T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/bettenj

IRD	Inherited Retinal Dystrophies	Inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD) as one of the rare ocular diseases encompasses different types of hereditary retinal degenerations appearing by involvement of the different layers of the posterior ocular segment. In respect of the importance of the classification systems regarding the recorded history of biologic and natural sciences, there is no classification regarding the IRD diagnoses. Therefore, a novel classification for this type of hereditary ocular disease was developed and presented.

HERO	Healthcare Monitoring and Emergency Response Ontology	This ontology is designed to support a healthcare monitoring system that leverages wearable devices and Semantic Web technologies to continuously monitor patient vital signs, assess their medical conditions, and provide timely alerts and interventions in case of abnormalities or emergencies. It aims to enhance patient care, safety, and decision-making by integrating ontology-based reasoning, SWRL rules, and real-time data from various sources.\r\n\r\nMain Features:\r\n- Integration of Diverse Data Sources: The ontology integrates different data models like FHIR (for electronic health records and medical data), SOSA (for sensor data and vital signs), and FOAF (for patient profile management). This integration allows for a comprehensive representation of both static and dynamic patient data, supporting more accurate monitoring and decision-making.\r\n\r\n- Vital Sign Monitoring: It includes classes and properties for representing vital signs such as Temperature, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, and Oxygen Saturation. Each vital sign is associated with corresponding observations and results, following the SOSA ontology pattern.\r\n\r\n- Health Condition Assessment: The ontology defines multiple classes to represent different health conditions:\r\n  1- Normal Situation: Represents a state where all monitored vital signs fall within their normal ranges.\r\n   2- Abnormal Situation: Represents a state where one or more vital signs fall outside their normal range, but there is no indication of device \r\n       malfunction.\r\n  3- Wrong Situation: Represents a condition where at least one vital sign is classified as "wrong," indicating a possible malfunction of the wearable \r\n      device. This triggers alerts to the patient to check or repair the device.\r\n- Emergency and Critical Emergency Handling: In abnormal situations, SWRL rules are used to infer whether the situation is an emergency or a critical emergency:\r\n  Emergency Situation: Requires additional evaluation by healthcare providers. If the situation matches a previously stored case, the system \r\n  retrieves and recommends the previous prescription. Otherwise, a "risky alarm" is generated, and the patient's current and historical data are \r\n  reviewed to make clinical decisions.\r\n Critical Emergency Situation: In such cases, the system immediately alerts the emergency center, dispatches the nearest ambulance, and informs \r\n  the hospital of the patient's condition and estimated arrival time.\r\n  SWRL Rules for Decision Making: The ontology utilizes SWRL rules to automate reasoning processes for determining the patient's condition based on real-time data. These rules help classify patient situations into normal, abnormal, or critical states, enhancing the responsiveness of the healthcare system.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Workflow: The ontology supports a detailed emergency response workflow, which involves identifying the nearest hospital, dispatching an ambulance, informing the ambulance crew, alerting the receiving hospital, and continuously updating the patient with the ambulance's status.\r\n\r\nRange and Classification Definitions: The ontology defines ranges for normal, abnormal, and wrong values for each vital sign across various age groups, ensuring that the system provides age-appropriate assessments.\r\n\r\nData Provenance and History Tracking: The ontology captures data provenance, tracking the source and history of observations, which is crucial for clinical decision-making and system transparency.

WSIO	Web-Service Interaction Ontology	Web Service Interaction Ontology (WSIO) enables automated interaction with more complex Web services that are typical for example within life sciences. WSIO is however independent of the application domain and relevant for both SOAP and REST Web services, and for batch execution engines in general. If the interaction scenario with a Web service is nontrivial (and incorporates session handling), annotation with WSIO concepts will enable automatic generation of client programs, scripts, or interactive applications with a graphical user interface. WSIO also enables automation of different ways of data transfer and data un-/compression or en-/decoding. We strongly discourage providers from developing complex interaction and data-transfer/compression scenarios, however when needed, WSIO may enable smooth automated interaction with them. Future versions will support more interaction scenarios.

PDRO	The Prescription of Drugs Ontology	PDRO is a realist ontology that aims to represent the domain of drug prescriptions. Such an ontology is currently missing in the OBOFoundry and is highly relevant to the domains of existing ontologies like DRON, OMRSE and OAE. PDRO’s central focus is the structure of a drug prescription, which is represented as a mereology of informational entities. Our current use cases are (1) refining this structure (e.g., adding closure axioms, cardinality, datatype bindings, etc) for prospectively standardizing local electronic prescriptions and (2) annotating prescription data of differing EHRs for detecting inappropriate prescriptions using a central semantic framework. Future ontological work will include aligning PDRO more closely with the Document Acts Ontology.	https://github.com/OpenLHS/PDRO	Ryeyan Taseen	2020-02-25T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/vendetti

BTO_ONTOLOGY	Brain Tumour Ontology	The purpose of this work is to develop an ontology-based framework for developing an information retrieval system to cater to specific queries of users. For creating such an ontology, information was obtained from a wide range of information sources involved with brain tumour study and research. The information thus obtained was compiled and analysed to provide a standard, reliable and relevant information base to aid our proposed system. Facet-based methodology has been used for ontology formalization for quite some time. Ontology formalization involves different steps such as identification of the terminology, analysis, synthesis, standardization and ordering. A vast majority of the ontologies being developed nowadays lack flexibility. This becomes a formidable constraint when it comes to interoperability. We found that a facet-based method provides a distinct guideline for the development of a robust and flexible model concerning the domain of brain tumours. Our attempt has been to bridge library and information science and computer science, which itself involved an experimental approach. It was discovered that a faceted approach is really enduring, as it helps in the achievement of properties like navigation, exploration and faceted browsing. Computer-based brain tumour ontology supports the work of researchers towards gathering information on brain tumour research and allows users across the world to intelligently access new scientific information quickly and efficiently.	https://github.com/subhashishhh/BTO-Ontology/blob/master/BrainTumour_ontology.owl	SUBHASHIS DAS	2016-01-01T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/subhashis
MCCL	Cell Line Ontology [by Mahadevan]	Ontologies provide a common platform of controlled vocabulary for researchers who need to share information across a particular domain, inclusive of machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and relations among them. The need for ontologies that provide a systematic arrangement of available data and allow cross talk across various related domains is gaining momentum. In this backdrop, we have developed a comprehensive ontology on primary and established cell lines-both normal and pathologic. It covers around 400 cell lines. This ontology has been built to include the major domains in the field of biology like anatomy, bio-molecules, chemicals and drugs, pathological conditions and genetic variations around the cell lines. An extensive network of relations has been built across these concepts to enable different combinations of queries. The ontology covers all cell lines from major sources like ATCC, DSMZ, ECACC, ICLC etc. and is built in OWL format.	http://www.molecularconnections.com	Usha Mahadevan	2014-08-05T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/usha

SATO	SATO (IDEAS expAnded wiTh BCIO): workflow for designers of patient-centered mobile health behaviour change intervention applications	Designing effective theory-driven digital behaviour change interventions (DBCI) is a challenging task. To ease the design process, and assist with knowledge sharing and evaluation of the DBCI, we propose the SATO (IDEASexpAnded wiTh BCIO) design workflow based on the IDEAS (Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share) framework and aligned with the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology (BCIO). BCIO is a structural representation of the knowledge in behaviour change domain supporting evaluation of behaviour change interventions (BCIs) but it is not straightforward to utilise it during DBCI design. IDEAS (Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share) framework guides multi-disciplinary teams through the mobile health (mHealth) application development life-cycle but it is not aligned with BCIO entities. SATO couples BCIO entities with workflow steps and extends IDEAS Integrate stage with consideration of customisation and personalisation.\r\nThe SATO ontology provides the extensions of BCIO along with examples of a BCI Scenario of Fatigue Reduction.

ADMO	Alzheimer Disease Map Ontology	Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology is still imperfectly understood and current paradigms have not led to curative outcome. Omics technologies offer great promises for improving our understanding and generating new hypotheses. However, integration and interpretation of such data pose major challenges, calling for adequate knowledge models. AlzPathway is a disease map that gives a detailed and broad account of AD pathophysiology. However, AlzPathway lacks formalism, which can lead to ambiguity and misinterpretation. Ontologies are an adequate framework to overcome this limitation, through their axiomatic definitions and logical reasoning prop-erties. We introduce the AD Map Ontology (ADMO), an ontological upper model based on systems biology terms. We then propose to convert AlzPathway into an ontology and to integrate it into ADMO.

PDO_CAS	Plant Diversity Ontology	Plant Diversity Ontology (PDO) is the outcome of the construction tasks of domain ontology of science in the project of Scientific & Technological Knowledge Organization Systems (STKOS). The structure of PDO centers on species, including micro level of molecular, cell and tissue, medium level of plant organs, species and population, and macro level of ecosystem. The classes of PDO also capture the habitat, environmental conditions and expand the general characteristics of plants, completing the instances richness for plant species, geographical, classification and morphology. Furthermore, PDO builds the relationships among species, region, morphology, plant organs, developmental stage, revealing the list of species in an area, the morphology and life form of plants, and development process of species. In sum, PDO shows a growth process or development stage of a species and its structure characteristics in particular space and time scale, realizing the description of species diversity, ecosystem diversity and genetic diversity. At present, PDO has been applied to the platform of Go to Selected Open Access Journals (GoOA) developed by National Science Library of Chinese Academy of Sciences, supporting concept retrieval and concept extension for GoOA.	http://gooa.las.ac.cn/external/index.jsp	Ma Yumeng, Huang Jinxia, Liu Fenghong,Xu Zheping, Guo Jinjing, Cui Jinzhong, Sun Tan	2015-04-30T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/openresources

QUDT2-1	Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Types (QUDT Version 2.1)	QUDT presents a unified architecture for the conceptual representation of quantities, quantity kinds, units, dimensions, and data types, which lie at the core of all scientific and engineering inquiry. But the QUDT specification is more than a core architecture and a list of these concepts, because it implements international standards and thus provides the foundation for system interoperability. In order to provide for interoperability and data exchange between information systems, the specification needs to be available in a machine processable form, with no ambiguities. For these reasons, the QUDT approach to specifying these concepts is to use precise semantically grounded specifications in an ontology model with translation into machine-processable representations.	http://qudt.org	Steve Ray	2020-01-30T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/steveray

HNS	HNS_Ontolgoy	The purpose of this research is to develop an ontology with subsequent testing and evaluation, for identifying utility and value. The domain that has been chosen is human nervous system (HNS) disorders. It is hypothesized here that an ontology-based patient records management system is more effective in meeting and addressing complex information needs of health-care personnel. Therefore, this study has been based on the premise that developing an ontology and using it as a component of the search interface in hospital records management systems will lead to more efficient and effective management of health-care. It is proposed here to develop an ontology of the domain of HNS disorders using a standard vocabulary such as MeSH or SNOMED CT. The principal classes of an ontology include facet analysis for arranging concepts based on their common characteristics to build mutually exclusive classes. We combine faceted theory with description logic, which helps us to better query and retrieve data by implementing an ontological model. Protégé 5.2.0 was used as ontology editor. The use of ontologies for domain modelling will be of acute help to doctors for searching patient records. In this paper we show how the faceted approach helps us to build a flexible model and retrieve better information. We use the medical domain as a case study to show examples and implementation.	https://github.com/subhashishhh/HNS-Ontology/blob/master/HNS_ontology.owl	SUBHASHIS DAS	2020-05-05T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/subhashis

MWLA	Medical Web Lifestyle Aggregator	This ontology designed and developed in order to represent the detected intentions from the Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator. In particular, it seeks to represent what is involved in the gathering of data from the web and social lifestyle of user on the Internet. We decided, therefore, to develop the ontology using the Protégé v5.0, a free, open-source ontology editor from the Stanford University. The outcome of Protégé is available on the following URL:\r\nhttp://carre.kmi.open.ac.uk/ontology/lifestyle.owl\r\nThe presented ontology is generic and can support different type of providers (e.g. web searches, Facebook, Twitter etc.). Additionally, the predefined intentions are also generic supporting the majority of intentions in the Web. In the context of CARRE, we utilize, as a first attempt, the web searches as provider and we only upload the relevant intentions (health and travel) to CARRE in the private RDF repository.\r\nA user (representing an individual person whose data is being represented using the terms of this ontology) has connections. A connection represents that a Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer of user provides intentions for particulars providers. A connection is therefore associated with a UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) that represents an installation of the aggregator. A provider can be the web searches, Facebook or Twitter. A measurement is associated with a provider and a connection in order to declare the connection (i.e. the Web Lifestyle Data Aggregator of a particular personal computer) from which a measurement came.\r\nEvery measurement must have a date at which the detected intention was taken, a weight which defines the importance of an intention and of course the detected intention that is only relevant to CARRE. 	https://www.carre-project.eu/innovation/web-lifestyle-data-aggregator/	George Drosatos	2015-04-26T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/nporto

HED	Hierarchical Event Descriptors	HED (Hierarchical Event Descriptors) is a standardized vocabulary for describing what happens during experiments and a framework for mapping these terms and other metadata onto the experimental timeline to enable analysis. HED is a subtag system organized by the top-level categories: Event, Agent, Action, Item, Property, and Relation. Users create HED annotations as comma-separated, parenthesized lists of terms. See https://www.hed-resource.org for documentation, tutorials and other resources.\r\n\r\nRecently we have created an ontology representation of the HED vocabulary (HED schema) to provide a better mechanism for linking the HED terms to terms from other ontologies and to provide better provenance information. The HED tags as well as auxiliary information such as types of units and types of values are represented as classes. The HED schema attributes are represented either as DataProperty or ObjectProperty depending on their range. Some additional attributes that are not inherited are represented as AnnotationProperty. HED is the standard used for event annotation in BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) a standard for storing neuroimaging repository and is used by datasets on several repositories such as openNeuro and Nemar.	http://www.hedtags.org	Kay Robbins	2024-07-03T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/krobbins

MARC-LANGUAGES	MARC List for Languages	MARC List for Languages provides three-character lowercase alphabetic strings that serve as the identifiers of languages and language groups. The codes are usually based on the first three letters of the English form or, in some cases, vernacular form of the corresponding language name. The codes are varied where necessary to resolve conflicts and are not intended to be abbreviations of a language name. When the name of a language is changed in the list, the original code is generally retained. The codes in this list are equivalent to those of ISO 639-2 (Bibliographic) codes and some codes from ISO 639-5, although the language name labels may differ. They are linked to the equivalent codes in ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-5 and the corresponding two-character codes in ISO 639-1.	http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/languages.html	Nancy Lorimer	2022-04-25T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/nlorimer

ILLNESSINJURY	Illness and Injury	This list of Illness and Injury (Morbidity and Mortality) classifications is an abbreviated version of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Startup Mortality List (ICD-10-SMoL).  ICD-10-SMoL is the WHO's application of ICD-10 for low-resource settings initial cause of death collection.\r\n\r\nICD-10-SMoL was chosen because it is a simplified version of the ICD-10.\r\nICD (International Classification of Diseases) "is the foundation for the identification of health trends and statistics globally, and the international standard for reporting diseases and health conditions. It is the diagnostic classification standard for all clinical and research purposes. ICD defines the universe of diseases, disorders, injuries and other related health conditions" [http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/].\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 of this ontology was compiled for the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC) ontology project and reflects the need to have causes of death and health issues organized in a way to allow for analysis of cultural data.  A simplified list was deemed sufficient since the domain under study (cultural documents) will not have detailed medical information with regards to cause of death or health issues.  But instead of accepting a list of general usage terms for causes of death or health issues that appear in some sources (e.g. Wikipedia, Wikidatak, etc.), a standardized, medical classification was selected so that it could be of use for future analysis regarding questions involving the intersection of health and culture.\r\n\r\nICD-10-SMoL was chosen since it was the latest version of this list (June, 2018).  A stable version of ICD-11 was to be available in June 2018 but there was no ICD-11-SMoL available at this time.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the ICD10-SMoL:\r\nhttp://www.who.int/healthinfo/civil_registration/ICD_10_SMoL.pdf?ua=1		Deborah Stacey	2018-07-22T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/dastacey

ISO-FOOD	A formal representation of the knowledge within the domain of Isotopes for Food Science	To link and harmonize different knowledge repositories with respect to isotopic data, we propose an ISO-FOOD ontology as a domain ontology for describing isotopic data within Food Science. The ISO-FOOD ontology consists of metadata and provenance data that needs to be stored together with data elements in order to describe isotopic measurements with all necessary information required for future analysis. The new domain has been linked with existing ontologies, such as Units of Measurements Ontology, Food, Nutrient and the Bibliographic Ontology. So linked ontology consists of several superclasses, and for each of these the relevant subclasses, object properties and data properties are defined. To show how such an ontology can be used in practice, it was populated with 20 isotopic measurements of Slovenian food samples. Describing data in this way offers a powerful technique for organizing and sharing stable isotope data across Food Science. 	http://cs.ijs.si/repository/ISO-FOOD/ISO-FOOD_Ontology.zip	Tome Eftimov	2018-10-22T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/CS

INFECTION_TRANS	Infection Transmission Ontology	The Infection Transmission Ontology is developed in order to make transmission data reusable and interoperable. \r\nThe ontology captures every step of analysing data from the transmission process, especially for quantification of trans-\r\nmission parameters. It is applicable to animal and human (hospital) data from both experimental and observational stud-\r\nies.\r\n\r\nThe lack of a common terminology in the infection transmission experiments leads to repetition of costly experiments. By developing a domain ontology we can reuse and combine the transmission data, which leads to the improvement of an estimation of transmission parameters and prediction of outcomes of yet unobserved situations.	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UtrechtUniversity/summer-fair/master/src/create_ontology/map_ontology/infection_trans.owl#	Elena Slavco	2022-07-13T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/e.slavco

RXNORM	RxNORM	<p>RxNorm is intended to cover all prescription medications approved for human use in the United States. Prescription medications from other countries may be included as opportunities allow, a principal consideration being that there be an authoritative source of information about these drugs. Drugs are added to the vocabulary as new products are put on the market. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications will be added and covered, as well, when reliable information about the medications can be found. Drugs are added to the vocabulary as new products are put on the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An RxNorm clinical drug name reflects the active ingredients, strengths, and dose form composing that drug. When any of these elements vary, a new RxNorm drug name is created as a separate concept. Thus, an RxNorm name should exist for every strength and dose of every available combination of clinically significant ingredients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Drug Codes (NDCs) for specific drug products are linked to that product in RxNorm. RxNorm links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software, including those of First Databank, Micromedex®, Gold Standard Alchemy, and Multum. By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary.</p>	https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html	RxNorm Customer Service	2024-11-04T00:00:00.000+00:00	https://data.bioontology.org/users/admin
