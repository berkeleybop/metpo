{'content': 'Sphingorhabdus soli sp. nov., isolated from Arctic soil.\n\nA Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped and non-motile bacterial strain, designated D-2Q-5-6T, was isolated from a soil sample collected from the Arctic region. Strain D-2Q-5-6T was found to grow at 10-43 °C (optimum, 28 °C), at pH 6.0-9.0 (pH 7.0) and in 0-5 % (w/v) NaCl (0-1 %). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain D-2Q-5-6T fell into the genus Sphingorhabdus and shared less than 95.8 % identity with all type strains of recognized species of this genus. The major cellular fatty acids of strain D-2Q-5-6T were summed feature 8 (C18 : 1 ω7c and/or C18 : 1 ω6c; 31.4 %), summed feature 3 (C16 : 1 ω7c and/or C16 : 1 ω6c; 26.8 %) and C14 : 0 2OH (11.7 %). The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and sphingoglycolipid. The predominant quinone was identified as Q10. The DNA G+C content of strain D-2Q-5-6T was 64.5 mol%. Based on the results of phylogenetic analysis and distinctive phenotypic characteristics, strain D-2Q-5-6T is concluded to represent a novel species of the genus Sphingorhabdus, for which the name Sphingorhabdus soli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of the species is D-2Q-5-6T (=MCCC 1A06070T=KCTC 52311T).\n\nPMID:31904318', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
