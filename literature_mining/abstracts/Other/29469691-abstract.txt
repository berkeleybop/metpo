{'content': 'Paracoccus alimentarius sp. nov., isolated from a Korean foodstuff, salted pollack.\n\nA Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-motile and coccoid or ovoid bacterial strain, designated LB2T, was isolated from a Korean foodstuff, salted pollack. Strain LB2T grew optimally at 25-30 °C, at pH 7.0-8.0 and in the presence of 0-2.0 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain LB2T belonged to the genus Paracoccus, coherently clustering with the type strain of Paracoccus sulfuroxidans. Strain LB2T exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 98.0 and 97.0 % to the type strains of P. sulfuroxidans and Paracoccus halophilus, respectively, and of less than 96.9 % to the type strains of other Paracoccus species. Strain LB2T contained Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone. Major fatty acids of strain LB2T were cyclo C19 : 0ω8c, C18 : 1ω7c and C16 : 0 (when grown on MA) or C18 : 1ω7c and C16 : 0 (on TSA). The major polar lipids detected in strain LB2T were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified aminolipid and one unidentified glycolipid. The DNA G+C content of strain LB2T was 61.4 mol% and its DNA-DNA relatedness values with the type strains of P. sulfuroxidans and P. halophilus were 26 and 18 %, respectively. Differential phenotypic properties, together with its phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness, revealed that strain LB2T is separated from recognized Paracoccus species. On the basis of the data presented, strain LB2T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Paracoccus, for which the name Paracoccus alimentarius sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is LB2T (=KCTC 62138T=NBRC 113023T).\n\nPMID:29469691', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
