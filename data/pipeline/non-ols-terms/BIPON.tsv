Forhandlinger: Videnskabs-Selskabet i Christiana 1864, 35) states that the speed of a chemical reaction is proportional to the quantity of the reacting substances. More formally, the change of a product quantity is proportional to the product of reactant activities. In the case of a reaction occurring in a gas phase, the activities are equal to the partial pressures. In the case of a well-stirred aqueous medium, the activities are equal to the concentrations. In the case of discrete kinetic description, the quantity are expressed in number of molecules and the relevant volume are implicitely embedded in the kinetic constant."

This process can occur only in prokaryotes, where transcription of an operon into messenger RNA and translation of that mRNA into polypeptides occur simultaneously. The general principle is that alternative mRNA secondary structures occur under different physiological conditions such as available amount of a particular amino acid. One set of conditions favors early termination of transcription. In the classic example of the trp biosynthesis operon, translation of the gene for a short, trp-containing polypeptide called the trp operon leader peptide pauses either at a trp codon (if tryptophan is scarce) or the stop codon (if trp is readily available). In the former situation transcription continues, but in the latter a Rho-independent terminator forms and reduces, or attenuates, expression of the tryptophan biosynthesis genes. Although the polypeptides encoded by leader peptide genes appear not to be stable once their translation is complete, it is suggested by recent studies that their nascent polypeptide chains interact specifically with ribosomes, specific uncharged tRNAs, or other cellular components to inhibit release at the stop codon and improve the function of transcriptional attenuation as a regulatory switch."
