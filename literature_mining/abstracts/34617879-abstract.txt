Agilicoccus flavus gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel member of the family Dermatophilaceae isolated from the Pearl River.

A novel actinobacterium, designated strain SYSU M44304T, was isolated from freshwater samples in the Pearl River Estuary. The isolate was Gram-stain-positive, aerobic, coccus-shaped, oxidase-positive and motile. The cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as its diagnostic diamino acid. The predominant menaquinone was MK-8. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine and seven unidentified phospholipids. The major fatty acids were C16 : 0 and C16 : 1. The G+C content based on genomic DNA was 73.2 mol %. The nearest phylogenetic neighbours to the novel strain were Mobilicoccus pelagius NBRC 104925T and Mobilicoccus caccae YIM 101593T. On the basis of chemotaxonomic and physiological characteristics and phylogenetic analysis, strain SYSU M44304T should be considered to represent a novel species of a new genus in the family Dermatophilaceae, for which we propose the name Agilicoccus flavus gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Agilicoccus flavus is SYSU M44304T (=NBRC 114808T=CGMCC 1.18608T).
