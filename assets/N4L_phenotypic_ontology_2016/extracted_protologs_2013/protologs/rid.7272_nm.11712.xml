The strain which has both L,L- and <i>meso</i>-2,6-diaminopimelic acids as cell wall components was considered to belong to the genus <i>Kitasatosporia</i>. Taxonomic studies described herein have led to the conclusion that it is a new species and the name was proposed for the strain as <i>Kitasatosporia cystarginea</i>.</s></p><p class="description"><s>Strain RK-419 is the type strain of <i>K. cystarginea</i>; a culture of this strain was deposited in Japan Collection of Microorganisms at RIKEN, the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research under the number JCM 7356 (FERM P-8006).</s></p></content></protolog>
