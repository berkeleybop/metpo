{'content': 'Polaribacter porphyrae sp. nov., isolated from the red alga Porphyra yezoensis, and emended descriptions of the genus Polaribacter and two Polaribacter species.\n\nThree Gram-negative, non-motile, strictly aerobic strains, designated LNM-20(T), LCM-1 and LAM-13, were isolated from thalli of the marine red alga Porphyra yezoensis. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolates were associated with the genus Polaribacter in the family Flavobacteriaceae and were most closely related to Polaribacter dokdonensis DSW-5(T) (96.2 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Polaribacter gangjinensis K17-16(T) (95.0 %). The DNA G+C content of the isolates was 28.6-29.2 mol%. DNA-DNA hybridization analysis showed that the isolates belonged to a single species distinct from both of their closest relatives. The only isoprenoid quinone detected was menaquinone-6. The main polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified aminolipids and two unidentified lipids. The major fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 1Ï‰10c and iso-C15 : 0 3-OH. The phenotypic features of strain LNM-20(T) differed from those of their closest relatives in several regards (colony colour, growth with 1 % NaCl and on TSA plus 2.5 % NaCl, hydrolysis of Tweens 40 and 80, and oxidization of five carbon compounds). On the basis of phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic analysis, the isolates represent a novel species in the genus Polaribacter, for which the name Polaribacter porphyrae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is LNM-20(T) ( = LMG 26671(T) = NBRC 108759(T)). Emended descriptions of the genus Polaribacter and P. dokdonensis and P. gangjinensis are also proposed.\n\nPMID:22904227', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
