Colonies are white to light yellow. Cells grow in nutrient broth, PYG broth, and peptone water. A water-soluble fluorescent pigment is not produced on King A and King B media. Granules of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate accumulate in the cells. The methyl red test is negative. Indole and hydrogen sulfide are not produced. Hydrolysis of gelatin and starch does not occur. Ammonia is produced. Denitrification is negative. Litmus milk is not changed. Acid is produced from sugars oxidatively , but not fermentatively . Peptone and Casamino Acids are utilized as carbon sources and nitrogen sources. Urease and oxidase are produced. Aerobic. Metabolism is strictly respiratory and not fermentative. Good growth occurs between pH 6.0 and 8.0 and at 30°C. Growth does not occur in medium containing 3% sodium chloride. The DNA base composition ranges from 63 to 68 mol% G+C. The cellular fatty acids consist of large amounts of octadecenoic (C<sub>18:1</sub>) acid, as well as hexadecanoic (C<sub>16:0</sub>) and hexadecenoic (C<sub>16:1</sub>) acids. The major ubiquinone is ubiquinone Q-10.</s></p><p class="description"><s>The type species is <i>M. dimorpha</i> Gray and Thornton 1928.</s><s>The differential characteristics of <i>Mycoplana</i> species and other genera of gram-negative branching bacteria are shown in Table 9.</s></p></content></protolog>
