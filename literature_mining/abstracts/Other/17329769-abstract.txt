{'content': 'Reclassification of Trichlorobacter thiogenes as Geobacter thiogenes comb. nov.\n\nReclassification of the species Trichlorobacter thiogenes as Geobacter thiogenes comb. nov. is proposed on the basis of physiological traits and phylogenetic position. Characteristics additional to those provided in the original description revealed that the type strain (strain K1(T)=ATCC BAA-34(T)=JCM 14045(T)) has the ability to use Fe(III) as an electron acceptor for acetate oxidation and has an electron donor and acceptor profile typical of a Geobacter species, contains abundant c-type cytochromes, and has a temperature optimum of 30 degrees C and a pH optimum near pH 7.0; traits typical of members of the genus Geobacter. Phylogenetic analysis of nifD, recA, gyrB, rpoB, fusA and 16S rRNA genes further indicated that T. thiogenes falls within the Geobacter cluster of the family Geobacteraceae. Based on extensive phylogenetic evidence and the fact that T. thiogenes has the hallmark physiological characteristics of a Geobacter species, Trichlorobacter thiogenes should be reclassified as a member of the genus Geobacter.\n\nPMID:17329769', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
