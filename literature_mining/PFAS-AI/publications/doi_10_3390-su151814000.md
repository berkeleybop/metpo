Abstract
The principal objective of the present research involved the
achievement of high biodegradation degrees of perfluorooctanoic
acid (PFOA) and perfluorosulfonic acid (PFOS) using pure
individual bacterial strains. The use of such microorganisms can
contribute to the improvement of the wastewater treatment process
in sewage treatment plants through bioaugmentation or other
bioremediation processes. Thus, in this study, we investigated the
biodegradation potential of PFOA and PFOS. Bacterial strains tested
in this study were from the Pseudomonas genus, namely:
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida, due to their
known capacity to degrade xenobiotic compounds. The results
indicated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was able to transform
27.9% of PFOA and 47.3% of PFOS in 96 h, while Pseudomonas
putida managed to transform 19.0% of PFOA and 46.9% of PFOS in
the same time frame. During the biodegradation tests, PFHxA was
recognized as the principal biotransformation product of PFOA in
the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and PFPeA, PFPxA and
PFHpA were recognized as the biotransformation products in the
presence of Pseudomonas putida. For PFOS, only two
biotransformation products (PHHxA and PFHpA) were observed as
a consequence of biodegradation by both bacterial strains.

1. Introduction
Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are
recognized being highly difficult organic contaminants to treat in
aquatic ecosystems [1]. PFAS are used widely in a variety of
customer products. For this reason, these substances are considered
to be omnipresent in the environment and are highly persistent.
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorosulfonic acid (PFOS)
are two of the most common PFAS; they have been extensively

## Page 14

produced and can also be obtained by degradation processes of
various precursors. PFOS and PFOA were found in many
environmental compartments and represent a great concern for
both biota and human health [2,3]. The negative effects of PFOA
and PFOS on the wildlife and humans could be summarized in the
wide distribution, huge persistence, bioaccumulation predisposition
and potential toxicological repercussions [4,5,6,7]. Therefore,
finding new biodegradation methods for destruction of these
organic pollutants represents a matter of increasing necessity, as
does considering economically and eco-friendly methods.
In spite of the initial discouraging experimental data regarding the
biodegradability of PFAS under environmental conditions, because
of their high resistance, scientists continued to analyze different
microorganisms for their ability to degrade PFAS. In the last
decade, several studies discovered that different single or mixed
microbial types were able to degrade some PFAS compounds, such
as perfluorinated alkyl acids (PFAA), PFOA and PFOS
[8,9,10,11,12]. The cases where biodegradation has been successful
have created opportunities for biological treatment with PFAS,
although the transformation depends on the systemic intricacy of
the PFAS species, the microscopic organism types and the
environmental circumstances.
It is well known that the carbon–fluoride covalent bond is one of
the strongest in organic chemistry. For this reason, the direct
enzymatic action and microbial degradation of such substances are
hard to accomplish [13,14]. Even so, some recent studies have
showed that naturally existing microorganisms’ own enzymes could
break the carbon–fluoride bonds in normal conditions (25 °C and
neutral pH) [15,16,17]. Moreover, some bacteria strains can
catalyze the splitting of the C-F bond through reductive [17,18,19],
oxygenolytic [20], hydration [21] and hydrolytic [22] mechanisms.
Studies on this topic have reported that bacterial species degrade
PFAS in the presence or absence of oxygen (Table 1). Almost all of
the accessible studies present the biodegradation of PFAS
compounds using different cultures isolated from solid
environmental compartments (soil, sludge or sediments) [23,24,25].
Biodegradability studies of PFAS and fluorotelomer species using
bacterial strains were predominantly communicated in the
preceding literature. Following the biodegradability studies of some
fluorotelomers, using activated sludge in the presence of free

## Page 15

oxygen, it was observed that some similar major products were
obtained during the process, among them perfluorohexanoic acid
(PFHxA) and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) [23]. While limited
fluorinated PFAS compounds are rapidly transformable under
different microorganisms’ activities, completely fluorinated species,
such as PFOA and PFOS, have higher stability and were assumed to
be non-biodegradable [24,26,27].
Based on the low levels of PFAS substances in wastewater treatment
plants’ effluents, both aerobic and anaerobic degradation of PFOA
and PFOS were tested [28]. The data revealed that none of the
PFOA or PFOS were transformed under aerobic conditions; in
comparison, the anaerobic condition achieved almost maximum
degradation of PFOA and PFOS.
Pseudomonas sp. looks to be an appropriate candidate for the
biodegradation treatment of PFOA and PFOS, as well as for other
similar compounds. The achievement of PFOS biotransformation
was communicated for the first time in 2014, with up to 67%
removal efficiency [9]. The major biotransformation products of
PFOS under Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain HJ4 activity were
perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) and perfluorohexanesulfonic
acid (PFHxS) [9]. Pseudomonas plecoglossicida was later revealed
to biotransform PFOS with higher removal efficiency (up to 75% in
soil and up to 100% in laboratory mineral medium) [29]. In 2016,
the bacterial strain Pseudomonas parafulva YAB1 was isolated from
soil contaminated with perfluorinated compounds, and it was
shown to reduce PFOA 13–48% under laboratory conditions [10].
Recently, in 2019, the biological removal of PFAS species using
Acidimicrobium sp. Strain A6 proved to be an alternative
biodegradation technique of PFA compounds, using them as
electron acceptors in the Feammox bacterial procedure [8].
Recent research on PFAS biodegradation has demonstrated that the
Gordonia sp. aerobic strain NB4-1Y could remove fluorotelomer
compounds with great efficiency (up to 88%) within 7 days [31]. In
addition, Pseudomonas plecoglossicida 2.4-D was able to degrade
PFOS, obtaining perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) as major
biotransformation product, in less than 6 days [29].
An important and well-known benefit of biodegradation procedures
is cost efficiency, with minimum investments in resources and
energy. Anyway, compared to physical–chemical approaches, the
most important disadvantage of removing organic compounds based

## Page 16

on microorganisms’ activity is that it is a time-consuming process.
The biodegradation process of PFAS can take from a few days to a
few weeks for equilibrium to be established (Table 1), compared to
physical–chemical treatments, which can take a much shorter
period of time. Therefore, a significant direction of study was to
find new effective bacterial strains that can quickly remove PFAS
from various environmental matrices. While different suppositions
for biodegradation are confused, preliminary data suggest the
probability of fast biodegradation for PFAS compounds,
encouraging future investigations for the development of PFAS
biodegradation technology using bacterial strains.
The purpose of the study was to investigate the ability and
efficiency of two Pseudomonas bacterial strains, namely
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida, to degrade
PFOA and PFOS. The use of such microorganisms can contribute to
the improvement of the wastewater treatment process in
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) through bioaugmentation or
other bioremediation processes. Bacteria are economical
alternatives compared to other processes, such as the catalytical
ones, which can constitute an additional step in WWTPs. The study
followed three principal objectives: (a) to evaluate the
biodegradation degree of PFOA and PFOS by P. aeruginosa and P.
putida during 96 h of incubation; (b) to evaluate the pollution stress
caused by PFOA and PFOS to the Pseudomonas bacteria strains; (c)
to establish a possible (bio)degradation pathway for PFOA and
PFOS.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Chemicals and Reagents
Analytical standards (purity > 99%): perfluorobutanoic acid
(PFBA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorohexanoic acid
(PFHxA), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorooctanoic acid
(PFOA), perfluorosulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid
(PFNA) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA).
Acetonitrile (ACN, HPLC grade) and Methanol (MeOH, HPLC grade)
were provided by Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and ammonium

## Page 17

acetate (≥98%) from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany).
Ultrapure water was obtained in-house using a Milli-Q water system
purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).
Specific solid culture medium, namely trypticase soy agar, was
obtained from VWR Chemicals (Leuven, Belgium). The liquid
culture medium, namely acetamide broth, was acquired from
Scharlau (Spain). Pseudomonas aeruginosa WDCM 00026 VT
000263 bacterial strain was purchased from (Saint Louis, Missouri,
US), while Pseudomonas putida (ATCC 17514) was obtained from
American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA.
2.2. Pseudomonas Strain Culture Growth
Evaluation of the biodegradation capacity of PFOA and PFOS by
referenced bacterial strains was carried out using two bacterial
strains from the genus Pseudomonas, namely Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (B1) and Pseudomonas putida (B2). Initially, the
inoculation of the bacterial strains was performed on solid nutrient
medium for 24 h (35 °C incubation temperature) (Binder GmbH,
Germany). After this period, a single colony from each of P.
aeruginosa and P. putida was relocated to a particular liquid culture
medium, liquid broth with acetamide (AN). Acetamide broth is a
liquid culture medium recommended for the differentiation of nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria, especially for the bacteria
identification and confirmation of the genus Pseudomonas. The
incubation period in the liquid medium was carried out for 24 h at
37 °C and 130 rpm (Incubator Innova 44acquired from New
Brunswick Scientific,). Bacterial growth was measured using the
UV-VIS spectrophotometer (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA)
at 600 nm absorbance. Bacterial strains with optical density (OD)
equal to 0.2 were used in the biodegradation experiments of PFOA
and PFOS.
2.3. Bacterial Growth Inhibition Evaluation
Bacterial strains with OD600nm equal to 0.2 were incubated for 96 h
in presence of PFOS and PFOA at three different concentrations: 10
mg/L, 1 mg/L, 0.1 mg/L. All the experimental determination of the
absorbance value, which is closely correlated with the bacterial
growth, was established according to a negative control represented

## Page 18

by the unseeded bacterial growth medium.
Bacterial growth rate in presence of the three PFOS and PFOA
concentration levels was quantified at OD600nm by comparison with
a positive control consisting of each bacterial strain (BM) in the
specific growth medium (acetamide broth), without the chemical
compounds. Furthermore, aliquots of 1 mL were extracted from the
incubation at 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h after
contamination and were kept at −20 °C until the LC-MS analysis.
Acetamide broth with each individual compound (PFOA/PFOS-M)
represented the control sample for the analytical experiments.
2.4. Chemical Analysis
The experimental analysis was performed through liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry technique (LC/MS-MS)
using an Agilent 1260 and an Agilent 6410B (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). The parent compounds and
biotransformation products’ chromatographic separation was
achieved on a Zorbax Eclipse C18 chromatographic column (2.1 ×
100 mm, 3.5 μm). The column temperature was set at 30 °C.
Samples of 10 µL were injected using an autosampler. The
compounds were eluted using a mobile phase consisting of aqueous
5mM ammonium acetate (A) and MeOH (B). The flow rate was 0.2
mL/min. The gradient elution program is shown in Table S1, having
a stop time of 25 min. To increase the sensitivity of the
determination, the acquisition of the triple quadrupole detector was
set in MRM mode with 6 time segments (Table S2 and Figure S1).
The optimized MS and ESI operational parameters are showed in
Tables S3 and S4. The biodegradation efficiency was evaluated
using the Equation (1)
Biodegradation (%) = (C0 − C)/C0 × 100
(1)
where C—concentration of the organic compound (mg/L) at time t,
C0—initial concentration of the organic compound (mg/L).
2.5. Sample Preparation for Analytical Detection
The test and control samples were thawed at room temperature and
vortexed for 1 min. The sample preparation method focused on the
precipitation of proteins and other interfering compounds existing

## Page 19

in the growth medium, with an organic solvent such as acetonitrile
to minimize the matrix effect that can affect the mass spectrometric
detection. To a 200 µL sample (medium—M, P. aeruginosa or P.
Putida in medium—B1/B2-M, PFOA or PFOS in medium—PFOA/
PFOS-M and P. aeruginosa or P. Putida incubated with PFOA or
PFOS at different concentration—B1/B2-PFOA/PFOS-C), 400 µL
ACN was added, vortexed (1 min) and centrifuged (at 14,000 RPM
for 5 min). After the precipitate was decantated, 400 µL of the
supernatant was moved to a 2 mL vial.
2.6. QA and QC Section
The experiments were performed in triplicate. For each sample
sequence, two blank samples, containing ultra-pure water and
methanol, and 2 standard solutions (1 and 75 µg/L) were analyzed.
The calibration curves were fit in the range of 0.1 and 100 µg/L (R2
> 0.9996), and all samples were diluted to their suitable
concentration. The method’s sensibility was tested based on the
analysis of blank samples (ultrapure water and MeOH). The
detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) limits were determined to
be 0.3 and 1 µg/L, respectively, with signal-to-noise ratio of 10:1.
Standard deviations were situated between 3 and 5%.
2.7. Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Office Excel
2021.
3. Results
3.1. Decrease of PFOA and PFOS in the Presence of
Pseudomonas Strains
During the tested period (96 h), for the control experiments
regarding the abiotic degradation of PFOA and PFOS, a decrease in
concentrations of the two analytes in the growth medium was
observed. The values of abiotic degradation ranged between 1.12
and 1.42% for PFOA and between 0.16 and 0.22% for PFOS.

## Page 20

Under the P. aeruginosa activity, a decrease in PFOA levels was
observed over time (up to 96 h). The biodegradation degree rose as
the tested concentration lowered (Figure 1a). Thus, at the end of
the experiments, after 96 h, the degradation percentage of PFOA
was 3.17% in the experiments in which 10 mg/L PFOA was used,
12.0% for the concentration of 1 mg/L and 27.9% for 0.1 mg/L
PFOA. The reported percentages were corrected with those obtained
in the control experiment. The increase in the percentage of
biodegradation with the decrease in the concentration of the
organic compound, in the presence of the P. aeruginosa, was also
observed for the experiments regarding the PFOS biodegradation
(Figure 1b). The values of the biodegradation percentages were
obtained after subtracting the values obtained in the control
experiment. Thus, in descending order of the tested concentrations,
the biodegradation percentages were 11.5% for 10 mg/L PFOS,
33.3% for 1 mg/L PFOS and 47.4% for 0.1 mg/L PFOS,
respectively.
The same pattern could be observed for the experiments performed
in the presence of P. putida. The percentage of biodegradation
increased with the decrease of the test concentration (Figure 2).
Thus, the biodegradation percentages, calculated after the values
obtained for control experiment were subtracted, were 1.84% for
the test concentration of 10 mg/L, 12.3% for 1 mg/L and 19.0% for
0.1 mg/L PFOA (Figure 2a), respectively. For the three PFOS
concentrations tested, the biodegradation percentages obtained
after 96 h from the start of the experiments were 6.35% for 10 mg/
L, 26.6% for 1 mg/L and 46.9% for 0.1 mg/L (Figure 2b).
Comparing the results obtained in the presence of the two bacterial
strains, it can be stated that P. aeruginosa shows a higher efficiency
in terms of the PFOA biodegradation process, while, for PFOS, both
bacterial strains affect biodegradation in a similar way for the
concentration tested.
3.2. Bacterial Growth Inhibition in Presence of PFOA and PFOS
The growth inhibition degree of P. aeruginosa in the presence of
PFOA increased with the increase in the tested substance
concentration. The lowest percentage of inhibition of the growth of
P. aeruginosa was observed in the case of the concentration of 0.1
mg/L PFOA, varying from 16% in the first 2 h of contact to 23%

## Page 21

after 6 h, dropping to 5% after 24 h. Thus, an adaptation of the
bacteria in the presence of PFOA after 24 h was noted both in the
presence of the concentration of 0.1 mg/L and in the case of 1 mg/
L, a fact corroborated with the increase in the percentage of
degradation of the substance together with the decrease in the
degree of inhibition of bacterial growth (Table S5 and Figure 3a).
The experiments regarding the evaluation of the P. aeruginosa
growth inhibition in the presence of PFOS presented the same
characteristics compared to the inhibition test of the same bacteria
incubated with PFOA, except that an inhibition of approximatively
3 times higher was observed for the lower concentrations in the
first 2 h of contact and up to 24 h. An adaptation of P. aeruginosa
in the presence of PFOS was noted after 24 h, when growth
inhibition was considerably reduced (Table S7 and Figure 3b). This
fact correlates with the increase in the biodegradation percentage of
PFOS (Figure 1b) along with the decrease in the P. aeruginosa
inhibition degree after 24 h and up to 96 h.
Regarding the growth inhibition degree of P. putida, a greater
variation was observed compared to P. aeruginosa throughout the
test in the presence of the same concentration levels of PFOA. The
inhibition degree was 100% at the highest concentration tested, 10
mg/L PFOA, while, at lower values, the percentage of growth
inhibition fluctuated up to 72 h (Tables S6 and S7). The growth
inhibition degree of P. putida in the presence of PFOS was higher
than in the presence of PFOA for all tested concentrations. Unlike P.
aeruginosa, for P. putida, a greater variation was observed during
the 96 h of the growth inhibition test in the presence of PFOS. The
P. putida growth inhibition was proportionally lower for the lowest
concentration (0.1 mg/L PFOS), indicating that approximately 80%
of the viable bacterial population, after 48 h of contact, would have
led to a compound degradation of 46.9%, compared to the PFOS
concentration of 1 mg/L, at which the percentage of biodegradation
was approximately 2 times lower. The biodegradation percentage of
26.6% in the case of 1 mg/L PFOS can also be deduced from the
fact that more than half, 56%, of the P. putida bacterial population
was inhibited after 48 h of contact (Table S8 and Figure 4b).
3.3. Biotransformation Products Sustain the PFOA and PFOS
Biodegradation by Pseudomonas Strains

## Page 22

Since PFOA and PFOS quantification might be influenced by sample
preparation and manipulation, identification and quantitation of
biodegradation products with shorter aliphatic chains in the final
samples of every experiment was used as supplementary key
confirmation of PFOA and PFOS biodegradation. During the
experiments that involved studies on the biodegradation of PFOA in
the presence of the bacterial strain P. aeruginosa, the formation of a
single biodegradation product was observed, namely PFHxA (Table
2). In the test where 0.1 mg/L PFOA was used, the formation of
PFHxA was observed 4 h after the start of the experiment and
increased from 0.12 µg/L to 0.57 µg/L. For the test in which 1 mg/L
PFOA was used, the formation of PFHxA was also observed after 4
h, but the concentration increased from 0.56 µg/L to 0.60 µg/L at
24 h, after which it started to decrease, reaching 0.36 µg/L at the
end of the experiment (96 h). This decrease can be based on the
biodegradation of this compound under the influence of the
bacterial strain.
In the presence of P. putida, PFOA biodegradation led to the
formation of three biodegradation products: PFHxA, PFHpA and
PFPeA, the latter being determined only in the case of the
experiment in which the PFOA concentration was 0.1 mg/L (Table
2). The formation of biodegradation products followed a similar
pattern, their presence being observed after 4 h from the start of the
experiments. Their concentration increased over time until 48 h,
after which they began to decrease, being biodegraded, in turn, by
P. putida. Despite the fact that its formation was observed only in
one test, PFPeA was detected with the higher values, the
concentration domain being situated at 0.39 and 28 µg/L.
Following the results obtained, it can be stated that the
biodegradation mechanism of PFOA by Pseudomonas strains
consisted in obtaining biodegradation products with shorter
aliphatic chains by removing a -CF2 group. The proposed
biodegradation pathway is presented in Scheme 1.
During the biodegradation experiments involving the incubation of
P. aeruginosa with PFOS, at low concentrations (0.1 mg/L and 1
mg/L), two biodegradation products were identified (Table 3). The
formation of the perfluoro alkylated derivative with six carbon
atoms in the aliphatic chain, PFHxA, was observed early, after 2 h
of the tests beginning. In the first experiment (0.1 mg/L PFOS), its
concentration increased until 48 h, reaching a maximum of 0.45

## Page 23

µg/L, after which it decreased, reaching 0.38 µg/L. In the case of
the higher concentration of PFOS, 1 mg/L, the values determined
for PFHxA increased up to 0.64 µg/L at 24 h, after which they
decreased, reaching a value of 0.16 µg/L at the end of the
experiment (after 96 h). A similar behavior was observed for the
counterpart with seven carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain, for both
concentrations of PFOS (0.1 mg/L and 1 mg/L). Its formation was
identified starting at 2 h and recorded an increase for 24 h,
reaching values up to 0.26 µg/L. After this period, the
concentrations begin to decrease over time.
The experiments carried out in the presence of P. putida also
highlighted the formation of the 2 biodegradation products (PFHxA
and PFHpA), when the concentrations of PFOS involved were 0.1
and 1 mg/L, respectively (Table 3). In the case of these
experiments, the formation of these products was observed starting
6 h from the beginning of the incubation experiments. The
maximum values were determined in the samples taken 72 h after
the experiments started, and then the values decreased in the
following 24 h. The decrease in concentrations of biodegradation
products after a certain period of time can be due, also, to their
degradation by Pseudomonas strains. For experiments that involved
the highest concentration of PFOA and PFOS (10 mg/L), the
formation of biodegradation products was not observed.
Although a relatively high percentage of biodegradation of PFOS
was recorded, the concentrations tested were low, and, implicitly,
the amount biodegraded was small, which made it impossible to
identify the unknown intermediates through an analytical screening
method. Thus, the proposed mechanism regarding the
biodegradation of PFOS by the bacterial strains P. aeruginosa and P.
Putida is presented in Scheme 2.
4. Discussion
The results obtained in the present study are very promising and
can be compared with those reported in the specialized literature
(Table 1). Studies carried out using the bacterium Acidimicrobium
sp. Strain A6 to remove PFOA and PFOS in the aerobic environment
reported values of the removal degree up to 63% for 0.1 mg/L

## Page 24

PFOA and up to 50% for a test concentration of 100 mg/L PFOA in
100 days, while, for PFOS, the removal degree was 60% and 47%
for test concentrations of 0.1 mg/L and 100 mg/L PFOS,
respectively, in 100 days [30]. Also, PFOA could be removed up to
48% in an aerobic environment in 5 days by the bacteria P.
parafulva Strain YAB1 [10], while the initial concentration of 1.8
mg/L and 500 mg/L were removed up to 67% in 2 days by P.
aeruginosa strain HJ4 [9] and up to 75% in 90 days by the
bacterium P. plecoglossicida [29], respectively.
The present work showed no abiotic PFOA and PFOS degradation
during 96 h and, subsequently, no degradation by-products. In the
presence of bacterial strains, there was observed a decrease in PFOA
and PFOS concentrations, which was correlated to a raise of
biodegradation by-products such as PFPeA, PFHxA and PFHpA.
Singh and his collaborators proposed a PFOA and PFOS
defluorination, causing a transformation into PFHxA and PFHpA
[32]. This transformation fitted our experimental model only when
bacterial strains were added, which meant that bacteria could
trigger defluorination and C-C bond oxidation [8]. The exact
bacterial enzymatic equipment involved in PFOA and PFOS
biodegradation, and, subsequently, defluorination, is not yet
characterized and will serve as the main theme of a further study.
Despite the fact that not many research papers focused their studies
on the identification of biodegradation products, PFPeA, PFHxA and
PFHpA were commonly biotransformation products of PFOA
reported in the literature, while, for PFOS, compounds such as
PFBA, PFBS, PFHxS and PFHpA were communicated as the major
biotransformation products [8,9,29].
The results of this research open new possibilities for the use of P.
aeruginosa and P. putida in the bioremediation of PFOA and PFOS.
Improving the bioremediation processes by bioaugmentation could
represent a simple, efficient, fast, environmentally safe and costeffective technology to treat PFAS-contaminated water.
5. Conclusions
The results obtained in this study demonstrate that pure
Pseudomonas strains, namely P. aeruginosa and P putida, could

## Page 25

successfully biodegrade two of the most used perfluoroalkyl
substances, PFOA and PFOS. Under specific conditions, the PFOA
concentration was biologically transformed up to 27.9% and 19%,
respectively, after 96 h of incubation time with P. aeruginosa and P.
putida, respectively. In the case of PFOS, the two bacteria were
more effective compared to PFOA. The biodegradation percentages
obtained were up to 47.3% in the presence of P. aeruginosa and up
to 46.9% in the presence of P. putida.
During the biodegradation tests, biotransformation products of the
two parent compounds could be identified. During the PFOA
biodegradation by P. aeruginosa, only one biodegradation product
was identified (PFHxA), while the biodegradation by P. putida led
to the identification of three biodegradation products (PFPeA,
PFPxA and PFHpA). The biodegradation of PFOS by both bacteria
strains generated the same two biodegradation products in both
cases (PFPxA and PFHpA). Although it was observed that PFOA and
PFOS had a significant impact on the bacterial community,
especially at high concentrations, the adaptation of Pseudomonas
chains was observed in all experiments, throughout the 96 h
incubation period. The promising results support the use of
Pseudomonas strains and their metabolic pathways, validating the
conceptualization of using Pseudomonas-based bacterial models for
PFOA and PFOS removal.
