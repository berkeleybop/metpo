{'content': 'Paraburkholderia caffeinilytica sp. nov., isolated from the soil of a tea plantation.\n\nA novel bacterium, designated strain CF1T, was isolated from a soil sample of a tea plantation and its taxonomic position was determined using a polyphasic approach. Strain CF1T was a Gram-stain-negative, facultatively anaerobic, non-sporulating, non-motile and rod-shaped bacterium. Optimum growth occurred at 25 °C and pH 6.0. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that the isolate belongs to the genus Paraburkholderia, showing highest levels of similarity with respect to Paraburkholderia sediminicola LMG 24238T (98.44 %). Additionally, strain CF1T, P. sediminicola LMG 24238T and Paraburkholderia aspalathi LMG 27731 formed a distinct group in the phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. The predominant ubiquinone was Q-8, and the polar lipid profile consisted of a mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified aminophospholipid, two unidentified aminolipids and two unidentified polar lipids. The DNA G+C content was 60.2 mol%, and the major fatty acids were C16 : 0, summed feature 8 (C18 : 1ω7c and/or C18 : 1ω6c) and summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω7c and/or C16 : 1ω6c). The DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain CF1T and its close relatives including P. sediminicola LMG 24238T and P. aspalathi LMG 27731 49.3±0.4 % and 38.3±0.5 %, respectively. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, phenotypic and genotypic data, it is concluded that the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Paraburkholderia, for which the name Paraburkholderia caffeinilytica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CF1T (=LMG 28690T=CGMCC 1.15103T).\n\nPMID:27469334', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
