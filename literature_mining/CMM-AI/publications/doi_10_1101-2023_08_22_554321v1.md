ABSTRACT

## Page 2

This survey paper provides an in-depth analysis of various machine
learning techniques and algorithms that are utilized in the detection
of PPI (Protein-Protein Interactions). For every technique examined,
the paper evaluates its efficiency, shortcomings, possibilities for
enhancement, and outlook for the future. A major challenge in
current survey papers focusing on machine learning algorithms for
PPI identification is the successful categorization of these
algorithms. To overcome this challenge, the paper introduces a
novel hierarchical taxonomy that organizes algorithms into more
intricate categories and distinct techniques. The proposed taxonomy
is constructed on a four-tier structure, beginning with the broad
methodology category, and ending with specific sub-techniques.
This structure facilitates a more systematic and exhaustive
categorization of algorithms, aiding researchers in grasping the
connections between different algorithms and techniques. Included
in the paper are both empirical and experimental assessments to
classify the various techniques. The empirical assessment judges the
techniques according to four standards. The experimental
evaluations carry out the following rankings: (1) the algorithms that
employ the same specific sub-technique, (2) the different subtechniques that employ the same technique, (3) the different
techniques that employ the same methodology sub-category, and
(4) the different methodology sub-categories within the same
methodology category. By merging the new methodological
taxonomy, empirical analyses, and experimental evaluations, the
paper provides a multifaceted and thorough comprehension of the
machine learning methods and algorithms for PPI detection. This
synthesis helps researchers make well-informed decisions. In its
conclusion, the paper furnishes crucial insights into the future
possibilities of machine learning techniques for PPI identification,
underscoring potential advancements and areas ripe for continued
exploration and development.
