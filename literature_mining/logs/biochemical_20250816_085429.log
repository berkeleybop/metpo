{'content': 'Meiothermus hypogaeus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic bacterium isolated from a hot spring.\n\nA novel moderately thermophilic, red-pigmented bacterium, designated strain AZM34c11(T), was isolated from the bottom of a 1000 m-deep drilled well located in a Japanese hot spring. Cells were Gram-negative and grew optimally at 50 °C, at pH 7.6 and with 0-0.3% (w/v) NaCl. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the isolate belonged to the genus Meiothermus. Levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain AZM34c11(T) and the type strains of recognized Meiothermus species were 88.2-94.8%. Strain AZM34c11(T) was distinguished from recognized Meiothermus species by its cellular fatty acid profile: iso-C(16:0) was one of the predominant components and hydroxy fatty acids were present only in trace amounts. The strain could also be differentiated based on its growth substrate preferences and characteristic enzyme reactions. On the basis of these results, strain AZM34c11(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Meiothermus, for which the name Meiothermus hypogaeus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AZM34c11(T) (=NBRC 106114(T) =DSM 23238(T)).\n\nPMID:21335495', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

{'content': 'Bacillus vietnamensis sp. nov., a moderately halotolerant, aerobic, endospore-forming bacterium isolated from Vietnamese fish sauce.\n\nFive strains of Gram-positive, endospore-forming, moderately halotolerant bacteria were studied taxonomically. Four were isolated from Vietnamese fish sauce and one from the Gulf of Mexico. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that these strains clustered within the radiation of the genus Bacillus but separately from recognized Bacillus species. DNA G+C composition of the isolates ranged from 43 to 44 mol%. Strains 15-1(T) and NRRL B-14850 showed high levels of DNA-DNA relatedness (82-100 %) to each other and to the other strains isolated here; they displayed low levels of DNA-DNA relatedness (<29 %) to the type strains of selected recognized Bacillus species. They grew in 15 % NaCl and optimally in 1 % NaCl, which is characteristic of moderately halotolerant bacteria. The isolates grew at pH 6.5 to 10.0 but not at pH 6.0. Their cell walls contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. The major isoprenoid quinone was MK-7 and the principal cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0). Based on these results, the strains tested were regarded as members of a novel Bacillus species for which the name Bacillus vietnamensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 15-1(T) (=JCM 11124(T)=NRIC 0531(T)=NRRL 23890(T)).\n\nPMID:15545444', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

{'content': 'Bacillus terrae sp. nov. isolated from Cistus ladanifer rhizosphere soil.\n\nA bacterial strain designated RA9T was isolated from a root of Cistus ladanifer in Spain. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences placed the isolate into the genus Bacillus with its closest relatives being Bacillus fortis R-6514T and Bacillus fordii R-7190T with 98.2 % similarity in both cases. DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed mean relatedness values of 29 and 30 %, respectively, between strain RA9T and the type strains of B. fortis and B. fordii. Cells of the isolate were Gram-stain-positive, motile, sporulating rods. Catalase and oxidase were positive. Gelatin, starch and casein were not hydrolysed. Menaquinone MK-7 was the only menaquinone detected and iso-C15 : 0 and anteiso-C15 : 0 were the major fatty acids. The polar lipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, one unidentified aminophospholipid, one unidentified phospholipid, one unidentifed glycolipid and one unidentified lipid. meso-Diaminopimelic acid was detected in the peptidoglycan. The DNA G+C content was 43.1 mol%. Phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic analyses showed that strain RA9T should be considered as representing a novel species of the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus terrae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is RA9T (=LMG 29736T=CECT 9170T).\n\nPMID:27983469', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

{'content': 'Pandoraea terrae sp. nov., isolated from forest soil, and emended description of the genus Pandoraea Coenye et al. 2000.\n\nA Gram-staining-negative, facultatively aerobic, white-colony-forming bacterium, designated strain SE-S21T, was isolated from forest soil of Jeju Island in Korea. Cells were motile rods with a single polar flagellum, showing catalase- and oxidase-positive reactions. Growth was observed at 10-40 °C (optimum, 30 °C), pH 4.0-10.0 (optimum, pH 7.0-7.5) and with 0-4.0 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0-2 %). Only ubiquinone-8 was detected as the isoprenoid quinone, and C16 : 0, C17 : 0 cyclo, C19 : 1ω8c cyclo and summed feature 2 (comprising C12 : 0 aldehyde and/or unknown) were found to be the major fatty acids. Phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, an unknown aminophospholipid, an unknown aminolipid and an unknown lipid were detected as the major polar lipids. Putrescine and 2-hydroxyputrescine were the predominant polyamines. The DNA G+C content was 61.0 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA and DNA gyrase B gene sequences revealed that strain SE-S21T formed a phyletic lineage within the genus Pandoraea. Strain SE-S21T was most closely related to Pandoraea faecigallinarum KOxT and Pandoraea pnomenusa CCUG 38742T with 98.8 % and 98.7 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, respectively. However, the DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain SE-S21T and the type strains of P. faecigallinarum and P. pnomenusa were 26.6±5.7 % and 20.5±3.7 %, respectively. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular features, strain SE-S21T clearly represents a novel species of the genus Pandoraea, for which the name Pandoraea terrae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SE-S21T (=KACC 18127T=JCM 30137T). An emended description of the genus Pandoraea is also proposed.\n\nPMID:27267599', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

{'content': 'Paenibacillus panaciterrae sp. nov., isolated from ginseng-cultivated soil.\n\nA novel bacterium, designated DCY95T, was isolated from ginseng-cultivated soil in Quang Nam province, Vietnam. On the basis of 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequence analysis, this isolate was assigned to the genus Paenibacillus and found to be closely related to Paenibacillus sacheonensis SY01T (97.1 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Paenibacillus taihuensis THMBG22T (96.4 %). The partial gyrB gene of DCY95T possessed 69.6-83.9 % sequence identity to those of other members of the genus Paenibacillus. Strain DCY95T was Gram-reaction-negative, catalase-negative, oxidase-positive, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped and motile by means of peritrichous flagella. Ellipsoidal free spores or subterminal endospores were produced in sporangia. MK-7 was the diagnostic menaquinone. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diamonopimelic acid as the diamino acid. Whole-cell sugars comprised ribose, mannose and glucose. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C16 : 0 and C16 : 0. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, three unidentified aminophospholipids, and two unidentified phospholipids. The genomic DNA G+C content was 60.7 ± 0.9 mol%. Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic results placed strain DCY95T within the genus Paenibacillus. However, DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain DCY95T and P. sacheonensis KACC 14895T or P. taihuensis NBRC 108766T were lower than 36 %. The low DNA relatedness data in combination with phylogenetic and (GTG)5-PCR analyses, as well as biochemical tests, indicated that strain DCY95T could not be assigned to any recognized species. In conclusion, the results in this study support the classification of strain DCY95T as a representative of a novel species within the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus panaciterrae is proposed. The type strain is DCY95T ( = KCTC 33581T = DSM 29477T).\n\nPMID:26294902', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

{'content': 'Agarilytica rhodophyticola gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from Gracilaria blodgettii.\n\nA novel Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, aerobic, agarolytic bacterium, designated 017T, was isolated from Gracilaria blodgettii collected at the coast of Lingshui county, Hainan province, China. Optimal growth occurred at 28-33 °C (range 15-40 °C), with 3 % (w/v) NaCl (range 2-4 %) and at pH 8.0 (range pH 6.5-8.5). Cells of strain 017T were motile and formed yellow colonies on marine agar 2216. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain 017T shared the highest similarity with Teredinibacter turnerae T7902T (94.4 %). The predominant polar lipids of the novel isolate consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, aminophospholipid and some other unknown lipids. Major cellular fatty acids (>10 %) were C16 : 0, C18 : 1ω7c and summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω7c/iso-C15 : 0 2-OH), and the sole respiratory lipoquinone was Q-8. The DNA G+C content of strain 017T was 40.2 mol%. Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and phenotypic characterization indicated that strain 017T represents a novel species in a new genus of the family Cellvibrionaceae, order Cellvibrionales, for which the name Agarilytica rhodophyticola gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed.

{'content': 'Myceligenerans cantabricum sp. nov., a barotolerant actinobacterium isolated from a deep cold-water coral.\n\nAn actinobacterium strain (M-201(T)) was isolated from a deep-sea scleractinian coral (Fam. Caryophillidae) collected at 1500 m depth in the Avilés Canyon in the Cantabrian Sea, Asturias, Spain. Strain M-201(T) grew at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0), between 4 and 37 °C (optimum 28 °C) and at salinities of 0.5-10.5% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0.5-3.0%). The peptidoglycan contained the amino acids Lys, Ala, Thr, Glu and one unknown amino acid component, and belonged to type A4α, and the cell-wall sugars are glucose, mannose and galactose. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, an unknown phosphoglycolipid and seven unknown glycolipids. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H4) and MK-9(H6). Major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0). The genomic DNA G+C content was 72.4 mol%. The chemotaxonomic properties supported the affiliation of strain M-201(T) to the genus Myceligenerans . Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the organism was most closely related to Myceligenerans crystallogenes CD12E2-27(T) (98.2% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). However, it had a relatively low DNA-DNA relatedness value with the above strain (48%). The isolate showed antibiotic activity against Escherichia coli , Micrococcus luteus ATCC 14452 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. carlsbergensis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of antibiotic production in the genus Myceligenerans . The differences in phenotypic, metabolic, ecological and phylogenetic characteristics justify the proposal of a novel species of the genus Myceligenerans , Myceligenerans cantabricum sp. nov., with M-201(T) ( = CECT 8512(T) = DSM 28392(T)) as the type strain.\n\nPMID:25667397', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

{'content': 'Chitinophaga oryzae sp. nov., an epiphytic bacterium isolated from rice root surfaces.\n\nTwo Gram-stain-negative, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterial strains were isolated from the surfaces of rice roots. They were designated as strains 1303T and 1310. Their colonies were circular, entire, opaque, convex and yellow. They were chitinase- and catalase-positive, reduced nitrate and grew at 16-37 °C (optimum, 30 °C), pH 5.0-10.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and 0-2.0% NaCl (optimum, 1.0 %). Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, they were classified as members of the genus Chitinophaga. Results of phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses indicated that they formed a cluster with Chitinophaga eiseniae YC6729T, Chitinophaga qingshengii JN246T, Chitinophaga varians 10-7 W-9003T and Chitinophaga fulva G-6-1-13T. When the genomic sequences of strains 1303T and 1310 were compared with their close relatives, the average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization values were below the cut-off levels. Phosphatidylethanolamine was the major polar lipid. MK-7 was the major respiratory quinone. iso-C15 : 0, C16 : 1 ω5c, iso-C17 : 0 3-OH and summed feature 3 (C16 : 1 ω7c/C16 : 1 ω6c) were the predominant fatty acids. Differential characteristics between both strains and their close relatives were also observed. Based on the distinctions in genotypic, phenotypic and chemotypic features, strains 1303T and 1310 represent members of a novel species of the genus Chitinophaga, for which the name Chitinophaga oryzae sp. nov. is proposed.

{'content': 'Halomonas dongshanensis sp. nov., isolated from the seawater of Dongshan Island.\n\nA taxonomic study was carried out on strain yzlin-01T, isolated from Dongshan Island seawater. The bacterium was Gram-stain-negative, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative, rod-shaped, and motile by polar flagella. Growth was observed at temperatures of 10-40 °C, at salinities of 0.5-18 %, and at pH of 6-10. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain yzlin-01T belonged to the genus Halomonas, with the highest sequence similarity to Halomonas malpeensis YU-PRIM-29T (96.7 %), followed by Halomonas johnsoniae T68687T (96.4 %) and Halomonas gomseomensis M12T (96.4 %), and other species of the genus Halomonas (93.4-96.3 %). The ANI and digital DNA-DNA hybridization estimate values between strain yzlin-01T and the closest type strain Halomonas malpeensis YU-PRIM-29T were 77.44 and 21.6 %, respectively. The principal fatty acids were summed feature 8 (consisting of C18 : 1 ω7c and/or C18 : 1 ω6c; 55.7 %), C16 : 0 (20.6 %), C12 : 0 3-OH (6.8 %), summed feature 3 (consisting of C16 : 1 ω7c and/or C16 : 1 ω6c; 5.1 %). The G+C content of the chromosomal DNA was 60.0 mol %. The respiratory quinone was identified as Q-9 (100 %). Phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, aminophospholipid, and three unidentified phospholipids were present. Combined genotypic and phenotypic data suggest that strain yzlin-01T represents a novel species within the genus Halomonas, for which the name Halomonas dongshanensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain yzlin-01T (=GDMCC 1.3202T=KCTC 92467T).\n\nPMID:37170873', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
