All of the strains were gram-positive, non-acid-fast, non-endospore-forming, pleomorphic rods. True mycelia were absent, but primary branching was observed infrequently. Cells were frequently arranged in V formations, which are characteristic of coryneform bacteria undergoing snapping or bending division. The amino acid and sugar compositions of the cell wall peptidoglycans of the sugarcane and Bermudagrass strains (Table 4) were similar to the compositions found in some phytopathogenic and saprophytic coryneform bacteria in this study and previous studies (4, 7, 33-37, 40, 50). The distinctive feature of the cell walls was the presence of 2,4-diaminobutyric acid. In addition, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid was found in the cell wall of <i>Corynebacterium michiganense</i> subsp. <i>tessellarius</i>, supporting the recent classification of this organism (1). The non-hydroxylated long-chain fatty acids of the sugarcane and Bermudagrass strains consist of predominately <i>anteiso</i>- and <i>iso</i>-methyl branched acids; only small amounts of straight-chain saturated acids are present (M. Sasser, personal communication). The DNAs of both the sugarcane bacteria and the Bermudagrass bacteria contained 66 mol% G+C, and this is within the range (64 to 74 mol%) for both phytopathogenic and saprophytic coryneform bacteria with cell wall compositions similar to those of the sugarcane and Bermudagrass strains (27, 47). The sugarcane and Berrnudagrass strains had many polypeptides of apparent common molecular mass as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but the two groups of strains were clearly distinguished. Both bacteria had polypeptides that were more similar to the polypeptides of the <i>Corynebacteriurn michiganense</i> subspecies than to the polypeptides of other 2,4-diaminobutyric acid-containing coryneform phytopathogens. It is noteworthy that we confirmed the close relation- ship of the <i>Corynebacterium michiganense</i> subspecies to each other (Fig. 3, lanes h and i), which has been observed previously for cells grown in a different medium (1).</s></p></content></protolog>
