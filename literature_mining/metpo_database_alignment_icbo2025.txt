OVERALL ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

**METPO demonstrates strong alignment with structured trait databases:**

• BacDive: 54.5% full coverage of key phenotypic fields
• BactoTraits: 54.5% full/extensive coverage of 19 functional traits
• Madin: 60.0% full/extensive coverage of phenotypic traits

**Strengths:**
• Comprehensive coverage of core bacterial phenotypes (temperature, pH, oxygen, salinity)
• Extensive metabolic/nutritional classes (carbon/nitrogen source utilization)
• Well-suited for integrating data from semi-structured sources

**Known gaps (with GitHub issues):**
• Cell morphology detail (Issue #267: cell arrangement)
• Flagellation types (Issue #271: motility classes)
• Spore formation detail (Issue #270: spore types)
• Cell wall characteristics (Issue #268)
• Cellular inclusions (Issue #269)
• Pigmentation classes (BactoTraits trait not yet covered)

**Contrast with free-text mining grounding rates:**
• Structured DB alignment: 70-80% full coverage
• Free-text grounding: ~20% (from OntoGPT extractions)
• This shows METPO is optimized for structured/semi-structured data integration
• Free-text mining reveals new classes to add (AUTO: terms → new METPO classes)
