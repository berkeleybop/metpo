L. m. <i>toxicus</i>, poison)</s></p><p class="description"><s>The description below is based on previously published data, the findings of this study, and our observations. <i>Clavibacter toxicus</i> cells are obligately aerobic, gram-positive, non-sporeforming, nonmotile, coryneform rods that are 0.6 to 0.75 by 1.5 μm, including a capsule that is 0.08 to 0.14 μm thick (1).</s><s>Surface colonies on 523M agar are convex, smooth, entire, mucoid, and glistening, with light- to mid-yellow pigmentation.</s><s>In old growth (&#x003E;3 weeks) pale yellow variants are common and form streaks or convex protrusions, and they maintain their pigmentation in subsequent cultures.</s><s>From cultured inoculum, single colonies take 5 to 6 days to appear, and from rehydrated anhydrobiotic material obtained from colonized ryegrass colonies take 8 to 14 days to appear.</s><s>Colonies are often variable in size because the adhesive properties of the mucoid capsule make dispersal to single cells difficult, especially with cells obtained from solid media and colonized plants.</s></p><p class="description"><s>Cell walls contain 2,4-diaminobutyric acid and glycine but no diaminopimelic acid or ornithine (20).</s><s>Acid is produced from galactose, mannose, and xylose but not from adonitol, dulcitol, erythritol, ethanol, inulin, mannitol, and melezitose.</s><s>Acid production from xylose is variable.</s><s>Acetate, glutamate, malonate, succinate, and tartrate are not utilized.</s><s>The maximum concentration of NaCl tolerated is 1% (wt/vol).</s><s>Strains do not grow at 37°C, and the optimum growth temperature is 26°C (17).</s><s>Catalase is produced; oxidase, urease, tyrosinase, and acetoin are not produced.</s><s>Nitrate is not reduced.</s><s>Tween 80 and cotton seed oil are not lipolyzed.</s><s>Unidentified growth factors are required for growth; biotin alone or in combination with nicotinic acid or calcium pantothenate is insufficient.</s><s>All strains are lysed by the bacteriophage described by Riley and Gooden (NCPPB</s></p><p class="description"><s>3778) (21).</s><s>The strains are slow growing, with a mean doubling time of 18 h in 523M broth at 25°C (twice the mean doubling time of the related organisms <i>Clavibacter tritici</i> and <i>Clavibacter rathayi</i>).</s></p><p class="description"><s>Allelic profiles differ by 20% between strains of <i>Clavibacter toxicus</i> and by at least 85% from strains of other <i>Clavibacter</i> spp. (24).</s><s>Polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbits reacts strongly with all strains but cross-reacts at a reduced level with some other <i>Clavibacter</i> spp., <i>Arthrobacter ilicis</i>, and <i>Rhodococcus fascians</i> (20).</s></p><p class="description"><s>All of the strains tested adhere to some populations of the seed gall-forming nematode <i>Anguina funesta</i>, the nematode with which it is most commonly associated in infested ryegrass, and some other <i>Anguina</i> spp., such as <i>Anguina tritici</i>, with which it is not normally associated (22).</s><s>The bacterium colonizes seedheads and nematode galls in ryegrass (19) and occasionally the seedheads of other grasses at the same sites (2).</s><s>It produces antibiotics that belong to the tunicamycin group (termed corynetoxins) in colonized plants (7); production of corynetoxins declines rapidly during isolation and subculture (16).</s><s>Inoculation of host grasses has limited success without the vector nematode (17, 23).</s></p><p class="description"><s>The type strain is strain CS14 (= ICMP 9525 = NCPPB 3552).</s><s>This strain is typical of <i>Clavibacter toxicus</i> in all of the tests shown in Table 2 and produces acid from xylose.</s><s>Its DNA base composition is 67 mol% G+C.</s><s>It was isolated in 1984 from ryegrass from a site in Murray Bridge, South Australia, where toxicity to grazing animals had been observed.</s><s>The site was infested with the vector nematode, Anguina funesta.</s></p></content></protolog>
