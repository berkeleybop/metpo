raw_completion_output: The provided text does not contain any specific 
  information about bacterial or archaeal taxa, strains, chemicals, or their 
  utilization. It appears to be a general description of a journal article and 
  its publication details without any scientific content related to microbiology
  or chemical utilization. Therefore, it is not possible to extract the 
  requested entities from this text. If you have another text or specific 
  content from the article that includes relevant scientific information, please
  provide it for analysis.
prompt: |+
  From the text below, extract the following entities in the following format:

  pmid: <PubMed ID of the article (e.g., 23996836)>
  study_taxa: <semicolon-separated list of the main bacterial or archaeal taxa being studied for chemical utilization>
  strains: <Extract strain designations WITHOUT genus/species prefixes. Remove terminal "T" or "(T)" suffixes. For example: 22A; AM1; MG1655; DA-C8>
  chemicals_mentioned: <Identify ALL metabolically-relevant chemical compounds mentioned in the text. Be comprehensive - include carbon sources, nitrogen sources, vitamins, cofactors, metabolic intermediates, enzyme substrates, electron acceptors/donors, synthesized products, degraded compounds, etc. For example: methanol; glucose; vitamin B12; cobalamin; trans-zeatin; siderophore; naphthalene; nitrogen; formaldehyde>
  chemical_utilizations: <Extract ALL strain-chemical relationships mentioned in the text. Be COMPREHENSIVE - do not omit relationships. Use EXACTLY the same strain identifiers from the strains field above.
  Include ALL interaction types: GROWTH: 22A uses_for_growth methanol; AM1 requires_for_growth vitamin B12 SYNTHESIS: 22A synthesizes trans-zeatin; MG1655 synthesizes cobalamin; DA-C8 synthesizes siderophore DEGRADATION: DA-C8 degrades naphthalene; MG1655 catabolizes acetate TRANSFORMATIONS: AM1 oxidizes methanol; 22A reduces nitrate; MG1655 ferments glucose NEGATIVE: AM1 does_not_use_for_growth sucrose; DA-C8 does_not_degrade benzene; 22A does_not_fix nitrogen
  Extract BOTH what strains CAN do AND what they CANNOT do. Be thorough and capture all relationships described in the text.>

  Biosorption of metal ions by phototrophic microorganisms is
  regarded as a sustainable and alternative method for
  bioremediation and metal recovery. In this study, 12 cyanobacterial
  strains, including 7 terrestrial and 5 aquatic cyanobacteria, covering
  a broad phylogenetic diversity were investigated for their potential
  application in the enrichment of rare earth elements through
  biosorption. A screening for the maximum adsorption capacity of
  cerium, neodymium, terbium, and lanthanum was conducted in
  which Nostoc sp. 20.02 showed the highest adsorption capacity with
  84.2–91.5 mg g-1. Additionally, Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973,
  Calothrix brevissima SAG 34.79, Desmonostoc muscorum 90.03, and
  Komarekiella sp. 89.12 were promising candidate strains, with
  maximum adsorption capacities of 69.5–83.4 mg g-1, 68.6–
  83.5 mg g-1, 44.7–70.6 mg g-1, and 47.2–67.1 mg g-1 respectively.
  Experiments with cerium on adsorption properties of the five
  highest metal adsorbing strains displayed fast adsorption kinetics
  and a strong influence of the pH value on metal uptake, with an
  optimum at pH 5 to 6. Studies on binding specificity with mixedmetal solutions strongly indicated an ion-exchange mechanism in
  which Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions are replaced by other metal
  cations during the biosorption process. Depending on the
  cyanobacterial strain, FT-IR analysis indicated the involvement
  different functional groups like hydroxyl and carboxyl groups
  during the adsorption process. Overall, the application of
  cyanobacteria as biosorbent in bioremediation and recovery of rare
  earth elements is a promising method for the development of an
  industrial process and has to be further optimized and adjusted
  regarding metal-containing wastewater and adsorption efficiency by
  cyanobacterial biomass.
  1 Introduction
  Rare Earth Elements (REE) consist of scandium, yttrium, and 15
  elements of the lanthanide series. These elements have exceptional
  electromagnetic, catalytic, and optical properties making them
  crucial for the production and development of modern high-

  ## Page 10

  technology products. Due to their similar chemical properties,
  separating REE demands sophisticated industrial processes that are
  energy-intensive and use environmentally toxic chemicals (Haque et
  al., 2014). Standard methods, for example, apply metal leaching
  with acids or bases and extraction methods to purify REE (Opare et
  al., 2021). Moreover, REE production is focused on a few countries,
  resulting in an oligopoly that can dictate supply and price regimes.
  REE are crucial for technology transition towards a renewable
  energy-driven society. For instance, cerium or lanthanum have
  applications in catalysts for air purification or chemical processing.
  Other metals like neodymium or terbium are crucial for producing
  permanent magnets or modern LEDs (Charalampides et al., 2015;
  Shan et al., 2020). Hence, industrialized countries increasingly
  focus on alternative supply routes and the development of cost and
  ecologically compatible recycling routes. In this context, REE
  recovered from dilute mining or industrial wastewater, as well as,
  electronic waste streams are opening new, regional supply routes.
  Establishing new biotechnologically based REE recovery methods
  therefore leads to enhanced market stability and supply chain
  independence for industrialized regions, such as the EU. Hence,
  there is a growing interest in the recovery and recycling of REE
  from industrial wastewater streams (Li et al., 2013; Barros et al.,
  2019). Over the past decades, biosorption has been regarded as a
  relatively simple and cost-efficient method for wastewater
  treatment (Volesky 2001). It is a physicochemical process that
  involves a solid phase (biosorbent) consisting of organic biomass
  and a liquid phase containing the dissolved or suspended chemical
  compounds to be sorbed (sorbate) (Fomina and Gadd 2014).
  Biosorption has a wide range of potential applications in
  wastewater remediation, including the removal of organic
  substances like dyes, pharmaceuticals, or pesticides (Bell and Tsezos
  1987; Aksu 2005; Crini and Badot 2008; Menk et al., 2019).
  However, most research on biosorption in conjunction with the
  removal of pollutants has been conducted on metals, including
  heavy metals, actinides, and lanthanides (Dhankhar and Hooda
  2011; Abbas et al., 2014; Giese 2020; Mattocks and Cotruvo 2020).
  Yet, developed processes based on biosorption have not achieved a
  commercial breakthrough. For example, it has been shown that
  environmental factors, such as changes in the pH value, can alter
  the affinity of biomass towards different elements (Zinicovscaia et

  ## Page 11

  al., 2019). A low technology readiness level, including a poor
  understanding of the underlying mechanisms, kinetics, and
  thermodynamics of the process are areas that require more research
  (Fomina and Gadd 2014; Elgarahy et al., 2021). It is widely
  accepted that the chemical structure, in particular the composition
  of functional groups on the cell surface, profoundly influences the
  adsorption properties of biomass (Eccles 1999; Volesky 2007).
  These active moieties may include hydroxyl-, carboxyl-, carbonyl-,
  phosphate-, sulfonate-, amine-, amide-, and imide-groups, among
  many others. Studies on biological, physical, or chemical
  modification of biomass by adding functional groups have shown
  that it is possible to improve binding specificity and capacity for
  target sorbates (Wang and Chen 2006; Park et al., 2010; Abdolali et
  al., 2015; Ciopec et al., 2020). Especially the recovery of REE with
  chemically modified organic polymers has been the focus of recent
  studies (Gabor et al., 2017; Negrea et al., 2018; Negrea et al.,
  2020). Nevertheless, these resulting biosorbents are still inferior in
  target selectivity to chemically synthesized ion-exchange resins with
  a defined structure and composition (Gadd 2009). Due to the
  heterogeneity of functional groups on the cell surface of microbial
  biomass, binding specificity for elements remains a challenging
  factor for industrial applicability. The adsorption of heavy metals
  by eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria is well documented (Al-Amin
  et al., 2021; Ankit et al., 2022). At present, the screening of new
  species regarding biosorption and potential novel applications in
  metal recovery remains of great interest due to high variability in
  cell wall composition and structure, resulting in differences in
  adsorption properties [e.g. (Micheletti et al., 2008)]. Cyanobacteria
  have shown promising adsorption properties for heavy metals,
  which could be used in the sequestration of metals from water on a
  technical scale. If similar adsorption properties exist for the
  bioremediation of REE has not been studied extensively yet.
  Moreover, the adsorption properties of terrestrial cyanobacteria
  were seldom investigated. Therefore, we taxonomically and
  biotechnologically identified new and promising cyanobacterial
  strains and evaluated their properties for REE adsorption. In this
  context, we also aimed to correlate taxonomic identity and
  adsorption characteristics. In this study, 12 cyanobacterial strains
  with broad phylogenetic origin and inhabiting different ecological
  habitats such as terrestrial, freshwater, and saltwater habitats were

  ## Page 12

  investigated for their potential applicability in an adsorption
  process for the enrichment of REE. Their phylogenetic relationship
  was determined using 16S rRNA sequences. The screening for
  maximum adsorption capacity with four different REE (i.e.
  lanthanum, cerium neodymium, and terbium), as well as the effect
  of several parameters on biosorption, including initial pH value,
  incubation time, and metal concentration for cerium, were
  evaluated. Additionally, binding specificity for cerium in the
  presence of other metal cations was investigated.
  2 Materials and methods
  2.1 Cultivation of cyanobacteria
  12 cyanobacterial strains with broad phylogenetic origins and from
  different habitats were used for the study (Table 1). The cultures
  were inoculated with approximately 0.1–0.3 g of wet biomass from
  a stock culture (stored at 17°C and light, dark rhythm 16:8 h at
  30 μmol photons m−2 s−1) in 1 L bubble columns containing BG11
  cultivation medium (Stanier et al., 1971) (or Spirulina-medium for
  Limnospira) (Andersen 2005) and cultivated at 23°C and light, dark
  rhythm 16:8 h at 300 μmol photons m−2 s−1 photosynthetic
  photon flux density). All cultivated cells were harvested using filters
  (two sieves of 0.5 mm and 0.1 mm and finally paper filters of
  40 µm openings), and wet biomass was dried by lyophilization.
  Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 was cultivated in a 3.7 L
  Labfors 5 Photobioreactor (Infors GmbH, Sulzemoos, DE) in BG11
  medium at 37°C and constant illumination at 300 μmol photons
  m−2 s−1. During cultivation, the pH was kept at eight by adding
  CO2 gas. Biomass was harvested by centrifugation after reaching
  the stationary phase.

  study.

  2.2 Phylogenetic characterization of strains
  About 50 mg of biomass from all cultures were collected during
  stationary growth phase and used for gDNA extraction with the
  DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit (Quiagen, Hildesheim, Germany)
  following the manufacturer’s instructions. The 16S–23S ITS gene
  region was amplified by PCR in a 50 µL reaction using the primers
  Wil1 and Wil18 (Wilmotte et al., 1993) and ready-to-go PCR mini
  beads (GE Healthcare, Chicago, United Sates) in a MiniAmp Plus
  Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, United Sates).
  PCR products were checked by gel electrophoresis using 1% (w, v)
  agarose and the E-Gel Power Snap Electrophoresis System
  (Invitrogen, Waltham, United Sates). Subsequently, PCR products of
  the expected length were purified with NucleSpin Gel and PCR
  Clean-up Kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG, Düren, Germany)
  following the DNA and PCR cleanup protocol and sent for Sanger
  sequencing to Genewiz, Azenta (Germany GmbH, Leipzig, Germany)
  using the primers Wil1, Wil4, Wil5, Wil10, Wil11, Wil16, and Wil18
  (Wilmotte et al., 1993). The generated sequences were assembled
  with Geneious Prime (v2021.0.1) software package (Biomatters
  Limited, New Zealand) and compared to already submitted
  sequences of those strains from public culture collections in terms
  of authenticity using the BLAST tool of the National Center for
  Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank. Sequences of strains
  that are novel were submitted to GenBank, and their accession
  numbers are given in the phylogenetic tree. The assembled 16S
  rRNA gene sequences and related sequences of cyanobacterial
  strains cited from GenBank were used for phylogenetic analyses,
  including Gloeobacter violacaeus as outgroup for the 16S rRNA gene
  alignment, applying the Muscle algorithm in Mega X (Kumar et al.,
  2018). The evolutionary model that was best suited for the database
  used was selected based on the lowest Akaike information criterion
  value and calculated in Mega X which was the RGT G + I model of
  nucleotide substitutions. The maximum likelihood method (ML)
  with 1,000 bootstrap replications was calculated with Mega X and
  Bayesian inference (BI) phylogenetic analyses, with two runs of
  eight Markov chains executed for one million generations with
  default parameters with MrBayes 3.2.1 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck
  2003). Each analysis reached stationarity (average standard
  deviation of split frequencies between runs <0.01) before the end

  ## Page 14

  of the run.
  2.3 Metal analysis
  The metal concentration in the analyzed solutions was determined
  via ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission
  Spectrometry) (Agilent 725 Series ICP Optical Emission
  Spectrometer, Agilent Technologies Inc., United Sates). A
  TraceCERT® Rare earth element mix for ICP with 16 elements from
  Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) and a
  Certipur® ICP multi-element standard solution IV from Merck
  (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) with 23 elements, were used as
  standards for calibration. Data analysis was done with ICP Expert II
  Agilent 725-ES Instrument Software Version 2.0 (Agilent
  Technologies Inc., United Sates).
  2.4 Biosorption
  Before the experiments, all biomass samples were washed three
  times with demineralized water to remove residual media
  components that could falsify the measurement results. The washed
  biomass was frozen at −80°C and lyophilized. Sorption experiments
  were carried out by incubating lyophilized biomass in metal
  solutions with a defined concentration. Each experiment was
  performed in triplicates. Metal uptake was determined by
  comparing the metal concentrations before and after incubation.
  Prior to measuring the metal concentration, each sample was
  centrifuged at 10,000 rcf for 5 min at room temperature. The
  supernatant was subsequently used for analysis. The adsorption
  experiments in this study predominantly focused on cerium, as it is
  the most prevalent REE.
  2.5 Adsorption capacity
  Adsorption experiments were performed based on a methodology
  described in previous studies (Heilmann et al., 2015; Heilmann et
  al., 2021). To determine the metal adsorption capacity (Q) of the
  different strains, 10–20 mg of dry biomass of individual species
  were weighed into centrifuge tubes and incubated in 2 mL metal
  solutions for 3 h under constant shaking at room temperature.

  ## Page 15

  Subsequently, the adsorption of the metals to the biomass was
  determined by dividing the changes in metal concentration by the
  amount of incubated biomass (see Eq. 1).
  Q=ni−nfm=ci−cf×Vm(1)
  with Q = adsorption capacity, ni = initial amount of substance, cf
  = final amount of substance after incubation, ci = initial metal
  concentration, cf = final metal concentration after incubation, V =
  volume, and m = weight of biomass.
  For the determination of the maximal adsorption capacity during
  the screening, metal solutions with a concentration of 10 mM and
  an initial pH value of 5 ± 0.2 were used.
  2.6 Adsorption kinetics
  Experiments on adsorption kinetic were carried out by varying the
  incubation time of the biomass in cerium (III) nitrate solutions with
  a concentration of 10 mM and a pH-value of 5 ± 0.2. Samples for
  analysis were taken after an incubation time of 2 min, 5 min,
  15 min, 30 min, and 60 min.
  2.7 Effect of initial pH value
  The influence of the pH value in metal biosorption was investigated
  similarly to the method previously described. The pH value of the
  applied metal solution was adjusted using hydrochloric acid and
  sodium hydroxide. Due to the formation of insoluble REE
  hydroxides at pH values above 7 (Plancque et al., 2003; Heilmann
  et al., 2021) the experiments were carried out ranging from pH 1 to
  6.
  2.8 Adsorption isotherms
  Adsorption isotherms were studied by varying the metal
  concentration of solutions applied to the biomass samples between
  0.5 and 10 mM. Samples were incubated for 1 h at room
  temperature under constant shaking and analyzed as previously
  stated. The adsorption isotherms were described using the Langmuir

  ## Page 16

  and Freundlich model (see Eqs. 2, 3). The Langmuir model is often
  used for the description of metal adsorption as it assumes
  adsorption in the form of a monolayer onto a surface containing a
  finite number of identical binding sites (Dada et al., 2012). By
  contrast, the Freundlich model assumes metal adsorption on nonidentical bindings sites over a heterogeneous surface (Koong et al.,
  2013).
  Langmuir model: Qeq=QmaxK×Ceq1+K×Ceq(2)
  Freundlich model: Qeq=KfCeqbf(3)
  with Qeq = adsorption capacity at equilibrium, Qmax = maximum
  adsorption capacity, K = Langmuir adsorption coefficient, Kf =
  Freundlich adsorption capacity constant, Ceq = metal concentration
  at equilibrium, and bf = Freundlich isotherm constant.
  Calculations for data analysis and model fitting were done using
  OriginPro 2020.
  2.9 Adsorption specificity
  Wastewater usually contains a mixture of different metal cations. In
  addition to examining the capacity for a single element of interest,
  it is therefore important to investigate whether some metal cations
  are adsorbed preferentially over others by the cyanobacterial
  biomass. Experiments were carried out with equimolar mixed-metal
  solutions with concentrations of 0.5–4 mM to investigate the
  binding specificity of the biomass for different metals. Following
  previous experiments on green algae and cyanobacteria by Klimmek
  (Klimmek 2003), the adsorption of cerium in the presence of
  aluminum, lead, nickel, and zinc was investigated. The uptake of
  metals by the biomass was measured using ICP-OES measurements,
  analogous to determining the adsorption capacity with single metal
  solutions.
  2.10 FT-IR analysis
  IR spectroscopy is a useful tool for the qualitative measurement of
  organic functional groups. In this study, IR spectroscopy was used
  to identify functional groups in cyanobacteria biomass samples and

  ## Page 17

  to detect possible interactions with metal cations. Samples were
  incubated in a cerium (III) nitrate solution (1 µmol 1 mg-1 biomass)
  for 2 h and subsequently lyophilized. IR spectra were recorded
  using a Nicolet iS50R FT-IR spectrometer from Thermo Fisher
  Scientific (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, United Sates)
  equipped with an iS50 ATR (Attenuated total reflection) multirange, diamond sampling station. For each sample, IR spectra were
  obtained in a range from 400–4,000 cm-1.
  3 Results
  3.1 Phylogenetic analysis
  Twelve different cyanobacteria, including four strains from public
  culture collections and eight environmental isolates were
  investigated. The identity of all strains from public culture
  collections was confirmed based on their 16S rRNA sequence using
  the BLAST tool of GenBank. The 16S rRNA sequences of the strains
  97.20, 02.01, 90.01, 89.12, 20.02, and SAG 34.79 were originally
  recovered, and their phylogenetic position was analyzed (Figure 1).
  In detail, strains 90.01 and 89.12 clustered well supported within
  the filamentous, heterocyte-forming genus Komarekiella while strain
  20.02 clustered within the genus Nostoc sens. lat. The strain
  Calothrix brevissima SAG 34.79 joined a cluster of other C. brevissima
  strains and strains assigned to the genera Tolypothrix and Scytonema
  with 100% identity. Strain 02.01 fell well supported in the large
  cluster of Scytonema hyalinum, whereas strain 97.20 could be
  assigned to Phormidium autumnale based on its high similarity with
  16S rRNA sequences from other filamentous, non-heterocyte
  forming strains representing this species. Thus, the cyanobacterial
  strains represent a broad phylogenetic origin out of the three orders
  Synechococcales, Oscillatoriales and Nostocales, inhabiting different
  ecological habitats such as terrestrial, freshwater, and saltwater
  habitats and most are new for biotechnological applications,
  particularly for their adsorption process of REE.

  sequences generated during this study. Since the resulting Bayesian
  Inference (BI) and ML phylogenetic trees mostly showed the same

  shown. Supports at the nodes greater than 90% statistical support
  from BI and ML represent posterior probabilities, and bootstrap
  values indicated as blue circles. The scale bar specifies 0.1 expected
  changes per site.
  3.2 Screening for maximum adsorption capacity
  In this study, the maximum adsorption capacity for REE (cerium,
  neodymium, terbium, and lanthanum) of 12 different cyanobacteria
  was investigated. The results of this screening are shown in Figure
  2, depicting distinct differences in total metal uptake depending on
  the species. There was no apparent correlation between the capacity
  for REE adsorption for the phylogenetic relationship and the
  ecological habitat. The highest overall metal uptake of the four
  tested REE was observed for Nostoc sp. 20.02 adsorption capacities
  between 84.2 and 91.5 mg g-1, while S. hyalinum 02.01 exhibited
  the lowest maximum adsorption capacity with 15.5–21.2 mg g-1.
  Based on these results, the biosorption properties of the five most
  efficient cyanobacteria (Nostoc sp. 20.02, Synechococcus elongates
  UTEX 2973, Desmonostoc muscorum 90.03, C. brevissima SAG 34.79,
  and Komarekiella sp. 89.12) were investigated in more detail.

  3.3 Effect of different initial pH values on metal
  adsorption

  ## Page 19

  The effect of the initial pH value of metal-solutions on biosorption
  of REE was examined in a pH range between 1 and 6. Experiments
  with 10 mM cerium (III) nitrate showed a strong influence of the
  pH value on metal adsorption (Figure 3). The highest metal uptake
  was observed at pH 5, with a minor decrease at pH 6. With
  increasing acidity, metal adsorption rapidly decreased. At pH 1, no
  notable metal adsorption was measured for all tested biomasses.
  These results are in accordance with previous studies on
  cyanobacteria, bacteria, and green algae regarding metal adsorption
  (Kuyucak and Volesky 1988; Gong et al., 2005; Lupea et al., 2012;
  Liang and Shen 2022).

  3.4 Adsorption kinetics
  As shown in Figure 4, metal adsorption for cerium (Ce3+) to all
  tested cyanobacterial biomasses occurred rapidly. The adsorption
  capacity equilibrium was reached within an incubation time of
  5 minutes. After this time, there was no significant change in
  adsorption capacity within 60 min.

  biomasses for Ce3+ (Qce, mg Ce3+ g-1 dry mass) with incubations

  3.5 Adsorption isotherms
  For the intended application of cyanobacterial biomass for the
  removal of metals from wastewater, high sorption capacities at
  relatively low metal concentrations are beneficial. Sorption

  ## Page 20

  capacities for the biomass of five selected cyanobacteria species
  were investigated at concentrations between 0.5–10 mM. The
  resulting data points were fitted according to the Langmuir and
  Freundlich model. The best correlation was achieved using the
  Langmuir model (Figure 5). Although the overall correlation with
  the model was weak, maximum adsorption capacities predicted by
  the model are in accordance with the values determined during the
  screening experiments (Supplementary Tables S1, S2). Adsorption
  capacities for all tested cyanobacteria exhibited a steep increase at
  lower equilibrium metal concentrations, showing that sequestration
  of metals is possible even at low concentrations.

  capacity Qeq, mg Ce3+ g-1 dry mass versus Ce3+-concentration Ceq,

  were fitted according to the Langmuir-model.
  3.6 Binding specificity
  The binding specificity of cyanobacterial biomass towards cerium
  was determined in adsorption experiments with other metals (Al,
  Pb, Ni, and Zn) in equimolar solutions. Starting with a
  concentration of 0.5 mM, the adsorption capacities were
  investigated for increasing metal concentrations up to 4 mM. The
  experiments showed that all elements could be adsorbed by the
  tested biomass. However, the metal uptake for some elements
  varied strongly amongst the tested metals (Figure 6). The
  adsorption capacity for zink and nickel was the lowest, whereas for
  cerium, the tested biomass showed the highest adsorption capacity
  in solution with a concentration of 0.5–2.0 mM. Nevertheless, the
  adsorption capacity for cerium in mixed metal solutions was
  significantly lower compared to experiments with single-element
  solutions in previous experiments. This indicates a competition of
  different elements for the same, limited binding sites on the
  biomass. The metal uptake of aluminum and lead steadily increased
  with rising metal concentrations. At a metal concentration of 4 mM,

  ## Page 21

  these elements even seemed to replace cerium as the binding
  capacity for this element dropped for all tested cyanobacteria
  biomasses. The analysis of metal concentrations via ICP-OES
  revealed a release of alkaline and alkaline earth metals (Na, K, Mg,
  and Ca) during the adsorption process. The concentration of these
  elements increased after incubating the biomass in the equimolar
  metal solutions containing Ce, Al, Pb, Ni, and Zn. By contrast,
  mixing the biomass with pure demineralized water did not lead to a
  notable increase in the concentration of alkaline and alkaline earth
  metals. This indicates an ion-exchange mechanism in which
  positively charged metal ions bind to the biomass and replace other
  ions that exhibit a weaker interaction. For all tested cyanobacteria,
  Na+ ions were the most prevalent ions being released. The biomass
  of S. elongatus was an exception, as Mg2+ and Ca2+ played a more
  important role in this case.
  FIGURE 6
  [image]
  FIGURE 6. Adsorption and release of elements from biomass
  incubated in equimolar mixed-metal (Ce, Al, Pb, Ni, and Zn)
  solutions with concentrations between 0.5–4.0 mM (n = 3).
  3.7 FT-IR analysis
  IR spectra of all analyzed biomass samples displayed signals that
  can be assigned to different functional groups (Figure 7). The broad
  band in the region around 3,350 cm−1 in the spectra are linked to
  the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups (Qian et al., 2018),
  whereas the signal at 2,920 cm−1 can be related to the C-H
  stretching vibrations of CH2 groups (Bhattacharya et al., 2014).
  Signals around 1,630 cm-1, which can be assigned to C=O
  stretching vibrations, indicate the presence of carboxyl groups
  (Qian et al., 2009). The strong signals around 1,040 cm-1 can be
  assigned to C-O stretching vibration in polysaccharides (Nakamoto
  2009). FT-IR spectra of biomasses after interaction with cerium (III)
  nitrate (Figure 7 blue lines) are characterized by changes in
  intensity and shifts in position of certain bands due to the
  interaction with the adsorbed metal ions. The first observed change

  ## Page 22

  was the attenuation of intensity in the region between 3,600–
  3,000 cm–1, indicating a decrease of free hydroxyl groups in the
  biomass (Mitic-Stojanovic et al., 2011). This was most prominent in
  biomass samples from D. muscorum 90.03 and Komarekiella sp.
  89.12. Likewise, changes in intensities around 1,630 cm-1 and
  1,040 cm-1 indicate an interaction with carboxyl groups (Qian et
  al., 2009). These changes were more profound for S. elongates UTEX
  2973, D. muscorum 90.03, and Komarekiella sp. 89.12. Distinct

  4 Discussion
  4.1 Phylogenetic and taxonomical remarks
  In the broad context of biotechnology, cyanobacterial strains are
  often used without respecting their ecological niche. This is a
  problem, because some taxa e.g. from aquatic habitats, often cannot
  be used during biotechnological processes that involve heat or
  desiccation, while others, such as terrestrial strains, are better
  candidates and vice versa. In addition, it happens quite often that
  results are not linked to strain identifiers or to wrongly identified
  taxa what can lead to an incorrect comparison and interpretation of
  data—a mistake that can remain uncorrected over decades (e.g.,
  Jung et al., 2021b). For these reasons we respected the ecology of
  the strains used in this study and depicted the phylogenetic
  placement of the strains. This creates a transparent background for
  the cyanobacterial strains that we used and allows others to better

  ## Page 23

  compare their results. Besides publicly available cyanobacterial
  strains with a clarified identity, several new isolates were
  phylogenetically analyzed during this work based on their 16S
  rRNA gene region (Figure 1). Among these were, for example, the
  heterocytous, false-branching strain S. hyalinum 02.01 that joined
  the large S. hyalinum cluster as outlined by Johansen et al.,
  (Johansen et al., 2017). In addition, the two true-branching,
  heterocytous strains Symphyonema bifilamentata 97.28 and
  Reptodigitus sp. 92.1 were included in the study in order to
  complement the setup of heterocytous, branching cyanobacteria.
  The strain 97.28 was treated as Fisherella ambigua for the last 50
  years of biotechnological research on secondary metabolites but
  was recently re-assigned as the type strain of the genus
  Symphyonema (Jung et al., 2021b). This strain has great
  biotechnological potential, because it grows fast and produces a
  diverse set of secondary metabolites, such as various ambigols
  (summarized in (Jung et al., 2021b)). The strain 92.1 was formerly
  treated as Nostochopsis lobatus, but doubts about this assignment
  arose because N. lobatus is only known from aquatic habitats.
  Recently, the new genus Reptodigitus was emerged, and the authors
  pointed out that strain 92.1 needs to be correctly described as a
  novel Reptodigitus species (Casamatta et al., 2020) which the
  authors of this study will carry out in a follow up study. In contrast
  to the above named strains, which are low producers of EPS
  (extracellular polymeric substances), the genus Komarekiella and
  related genera are well known to produce cells and filaments
  covered by thick EPS sheaths (Scotta Hentschke et al., 2017; Soares
  et al., 2021). EPS might play a role in metal adsorption (e.g. Al
  Amin et al., 2021). However, the two strains investigated here are
  the first strains of this genus described from a desert environment,
  while the other species of the genus have multiple origins, including
  lichen symbioses (Jung et al., 2021a; Soares et al., 2021; Panou and
  Gkelis 2022). All of them have a very complex life cycle in common
  that can hamper biotechnological applications due to different
  metabolic activity depending on the developmental stage of the
  culture. Also, the two strains 90.01 and 89.12 will be described as
  new species in the future. More challenging to interpret are the
  phylogenetic and taxonomical positions of Nostoc sp. 20.02 and C.
  brevissima SAG 34.79 (Figure 1). The strain 20.02 was isolated as an
  epiphyte on a cyanolichens and can be considered as a Nostoc strain

  ## Page 24

  not involved in the symbiosis because most true Nostoc lichen
  photobionts usually join distinct Nostoc ‘photobiont clusters’ based
  on their 16S rRNA (O'Brien et al., 2005). The overall taxonomic
  position of this strain remains unsure as it also does not cluster
  within the Nostoc sensu stricto clade. Similar uncertainties affect
  strain SAG 34.79 that could be assigned to C. brevissima based on its
  morphology and phylogenetic position, although there is no
  cohesive cluster formed and no type strain for the genus deposited.
  Closely related strains such as Tolypothrix tenuis SAG 94.79,
  Scytonema mirabile SAG 83.79, and T. tenuis J1 (Figure 1) need
  further investigation to clarify the state of the genus. Calothrix
  exhibits a notorious morphological heterogeneity and extreme
  polyphyly, which is evident from various independent clades in the
  phylogenetic trees of past research [reviewed in (Nowruzi and
  Shalygin 2021)]. However, even if no phylogenetic or habitat
  correlation with adsorption capacity could be found,
  biotechnological studies of cyanobacterial strains should be more
  often accompanied with phylogenetical studies applying the current
  standard for taxonomical classification by the so called polyphasic
  approach (Komárek et al., 2014) to identify taxonomic
  rearrangements and to avoid confusion regarding species names and
  strain names from culture collections for biotechnology.
  4.2 Metal adsorption experiments
  For microalgae, the bioremediation, bioaccumulation, or
  biosorption of common heavy metals such as Pb, Cd, Cr, As, Hg, Ni,
  etc. is often studied [e.g. (Ahuja et al., 1999; Ç etinkaya Dönmez et
  al., 1999; Mehta and Gaur 2005)]. The mechanisms behind these
  adsorption processes vary with species and environmental
  conditions (Kumar et al., 2015). However, different mechanisms are
  discussed, such as ion exchange, complexation, electrostatic
  attraction, and micro-precipitation (Kumar et al., 2015; Yadav et
  al., 2021). In contrast, the biosorption of REE is studied less. For the
  adsorption process of REE, the results in this study indicate an ionexchange mechanism in which cations of alkaline and alkaline earth
  metals (Na, K, Mg, and Ca) are replaced by other metal cations
  during the biosorption process with cyanobacterial biomass (Figure
  6). This is in agreement with previous experiments using biomass of
  different microorganisms (Crist et al., 1994; Matheickal et al., 1997;

  ## Page 25

  Sulaymon et al., 2013; Liang and Shen 2022). Ion exchange has
  been proposed as a dominant mechanism during biosorption (Chen
  et al., 2002; Iqbal et al., 2009). Apart from Synechocococcus
  elongates UTEX 2973 biomass, sodium was the predominant element
  during the ion exchange process. This differs from previous reports
  in which cations of earth alkaline metals were released in higher
  percentages (Iqbal et al., 2009; Sulaymon et al., 2013).
  Additionally, studies reported the replacement of protons with
  metal cations leading to a decrease in pH during the sorption
  process (Mashitah et al., 1999; Vasudevan et al., 2002). However,
  this aspect was not focused on in the experimental setup of this
  study. The strong influence of pH value on metal uptake shown in
  this study further emphasizes the correlation between charges on
  the surface of the biosorbent and the adsorbed metal ions. In
  previous studies, the effect of pH value on biosorption has been
  confirmed (García-Rosales et al., 2012; Abdel-Aty et al., 2013). At
  low pH values, functional groups on the cell surface are either
  neutral or positively charged. Carboxyl groups for instance are
  protonated at pH values below 3, whereas amino groups are
  protonated at pH 4.1 (Eccles 1999). As similar charges create a
  repulsive force, positive charges on the biomass surface repel metal
  cations, leading to poor metal uptake at low pH values. Previous
  studies described a strong influence of hydroxyl and carboxyl
  groups on the adsorption process for different biomasses (Gupta and
  Rastogi 2008; Luo et al., 2010; Utomo et al., 2016). Experiments on
  adsorption kinetics showed a quick metal uptake for all tested
  biomasses, reaching equilibrium within only a few minutes. In
  general, the process of metal cations attaching to adsorbents with a
  mesoporous surface involves two stages (Zinicovscaia et al., 2021).
  Specifically, the steps involve the migration of ions from the main
  solution to the boundary layer surrounding the intermediate-pore
  matrices, and the attachment of the metal ions to the active sites of
  the adsorbent material via adsorption. Previous studies have
  reported fast kinetics for the adsorption of metals on biomass of
  other green algae and cyanobacteria (Klimmek et al., 2001). On the
  other hand, experiments in other studies resulted in incubation
  times of up to 60 min and more before reaching the maximum
  adsorption equilibrium (Ahuja et al., 1999; Zinicovscaia et al.,
  2017). Fast metal uptake is a beneficial factor for the process
  development beyond laboratory scale as long incubation periods

  ## Page 26

  can be avoided, and higher flow rates can be achieved. Adsorption
  experiments with equimolar mixed-metal solutions were carried
  out, revealing a preference for certain elements influenced by the
  total metal concentration. The tested biomasses showed the highest
  overall adsorption capacity for Ce3+ at low metal concentrations.
  However, cations of these elements were replaced by Pb and Al at
  higher metal concentrations (2–4 mM) in this experimental setup.
  Zn and Ni showed to lowest affinity to the tested biomasses. Similar
  results have been reported for biomass of other microorganisms
  (Klimmek 2003; Wilke et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2018). At present,
  our ability to make predictions on binding specificity based on
  single-element adsorption experiments is limited (Wilke et al.,
  2006). Regarding a potential industrial application for the recovery
  of REE, these are promising results, as metal concentrations usually
  are lower than the highest concentrations in the experimental setup
  of this study. Furthermore, it should be considered that this study
  predominately focused on the adsorption of the element cerium.
  Due to high chemical similarities between REE, it is likely that the
  adsorption properties of the tested biomasses will be similar for
  other elements of this group. Nevertheless, additional experiments
  with other REE are advisable. Target elements could be extracted
  from the resulting metal-loaded biomass in follow-up processes. The
  destructive recovery by combustion, resulting in metal-enriched
  ash, is a simple method with the drawback of losing the initial
  biomass. An economically more desirable approach is the targeted
  desorption of elements from loaded biomass, enabling the recycling
  of the biosorbent. Previous studies have tested various approaches
  using different acids or complexing agents (Gong et al., 2005;
  Abdolali et al., 2015). Unfortunately, the adsorption properties of
  biosorbents are impaired over the curse of a few cycles (Hammaini
  et al., 2007). Future studies should address the binding specificity
  and durability of biosorbents to implement biosorption in industrial
  processes successfully. In competitive systems, the adsorption of
  different metal cations on biomass is influenced by functional
  groups on the cell surface. The interaction between metal cations
  and functional groups still requires more research. According to the
  current state of knowledge, various ionic properties of metal
  cations, such as electronegativity, redox potential, and ionic radius
  can influence the adsorption on biomass (Naja et al., 2010).
  Depending on the biomass and physico-chemical conditions,

  ## Page 27

  multiple mechanisms may be involved in metal sorption
  simultaneously (Gadd 2009). With respect to different
  cyanobacterial strains, FT-IR analysis indicated the involvement of
  various functional groups during like hydroxyl or carboxyl groups
  during metal adsorption. However, at present, there is no discrete
  chemical entity that has been identified as dominant cell wall
  feature that governs metal binding. In a previous study, for
  instance, it was shown that complex polymeric sugars are involved
  in the adsorption of terbium by C. brevissima (Jurkowski et al.,
  2022). Cell wall-derived binding entities most likely vary for every
  organism and metal presented.
  5 Conclusion
  In this study, a diverse group of 12 cyanobacteria was investigated
  for their potential in the enrichment of REE in a biosorption
  process. Metal uptake varied strongly among the tested strains, with
  Nostoc sp. 20.02 showing the highest maximum adsorption capacity
  of 84.2–91.5 mg g-1. However, there was no apparent correlation
  between maximum adsorption capacity and phylogenetic
  relationship nor for the ecological habitat of the strains. This could
  be explained by variations in the composition of metal interacting
  functional groups located at the cell surface. Moreover, many
  cyanobacteria that showed high adsorption capacities for REE
  produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that are known to
  facilitate metal adsorption (Pagliaccia et al., 2022). The
  composition of these EPS and their influence on the adsorption of
  REE should be further investigated in future studies. The
  determination of relevant parameters for improving the metal
  uptake revealed a pH optimum at 5 to 6 and fast adsorption kinetics
  reaching adsorption equilibrium within an incubation time of a few
  minutes. In addition, metal analysis strongly indicated an ionexchange mechanism during the biosorption process in which Na+,
  K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions are replaced by metal cations that bind
  to the surface of the biomass. These observations are in accordance
  with previous studies that were conducted on algal, bacterial, and
  other biomasses (Acheampong et al., 2011; Sulaymon et al., 2013;
  Liang and Shen 2022). The isolation of single target elements in a

  ## Page 28

  technical biosorption process remains a challenging task due to the
  complex surface structure and the heterogeneity of functional
  groups. Nevertheless, based on the results of this study, the
  enrichment of metal elements from diluted solutions is possible. For
  the development of an industrial process, parameters need to be
  further optimized and adjusted depending on the metal composition
  in the wastewater and the biomass that is used as biosorbent.

  Abstract
  The legume symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium, B. diazoefficiens
  strain USDA110, utilizes methanol for growth in the presence of
  light lanthanides, such as La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+ or Nd3+, and its cells
  possess significant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) activity. We
  purified MDH to homogeneity from B. diazoefficiens strain
  USDA110 grown in a methanol/Ce3+ medium; the protein was
  identified as XoxF5-type MDH (blr6213). The purified XoxF
  contained 0.58 cerium atoms per enzyme subunit. Moreover, the insolution structure of XoxF was analyzed by small angle X-ray
  scattering (SAXS) analysis; the radius of gyration (Rg) and
  maximum particle dimension (Dmax) of XoxF were calculated to be
  32.3 and 96.8 Å, respectively, suggesting that XoxF adopts a dimer
  structure in solution. These results show that B. diazoefficiens strain
  USDA110 has XoxF, a lanthanides-dependent MDH, which has

  lanthanaides, and that lanthanide is one of the important factors in
  methanol utilization by the strain.

  Significance
  Annual plants adapt to their environments by matching their life
  cycles, particularly seed germination and flowering, to the
  appropriate seasons. Although genetic evidence has suggested
  connections among genes regulating seed dormancy and flowering,
  specific mechanisms for such coordination are unknown. We report
  that a gene [DELAY OF GERMINATION1 (DOG1)] involved in
  determining the depth of seed dormancy, and therefore the seasonal
  timing of germination, also influences the timing of flowering in
  Arabidopsis and lettuce. We further show that this gene acts through
  influencing the production of microRNAs that govern the
  progression of developmental phase transitions through the plant
  life cycle, providing a molecular genetic mechanism for the
  coordinate adaptation of seed dormancy and flowering phenotypes

  to environmental conditions.
  Abstract
  Seed germination and flowering, two critical developmental
  transitions in plant life cycles, are coordinately regulated by genetic
  and environmental factors to match plant establishment and
  reproduction to seasonal cues. The DELAY OF GERMINATION1
  (DOG1) gene is involved in regulating seed dormancy in response to
  temperature and has also been associated genetically with
  pleiotropic flowering phenotypes across diverse Arabidopsis thaliana
  accessions and locations. Here we show that DOG1 can regulate
  seed dormancy and flowering times in lettuce (Lactuca sativa, Ls)
  and Arabidopsis through an influence on levels of microRNAs
  (miRNAs) miR156 and miR172. In lettuce, suppression of LsDOG1
  expression enabled seed germination at high temperature and
  promoted early flowering in association with reduced miR156 and
  increased miR172 levels. In Arabidopsis, higher miR156 levels
  resulting from overexpression of the MIR156 gene enhanced seed
  dormancy and delayed flowering. These phenotypic effects, as well
  as conversion of MIR156 transcripts to miR156, were compromised
  in DOG1 loss-of-function mutant plants, especially in seeds.
  Overexpression of MIR172 reduced seed dormancy and promoted
  early flowering in Arabidopsis, and the effect on flowering required
  functional DOG1. Transcript levels of several genes associated with
  miRNA processing were consistently lower in dry seeds of
  Arabidopsis and lettuce when DOG1 was mutated or its expression
  was reduced; in contrast, transcript levels of these genes were
  elevated in a DOG1 gain-of-function mutant. Our results reveal a
  previously unknown linkage between two critical developmental
  phase transitions in the plant life cycle through a DOG1–miR156–
  miR172 interaction.

  The life cycles of flowering plants are characterized by distinct
  phase transitions such as from seed to seedling (germination) or
  from vegetative to reproductive development (flowering) (1). The
  timing of germination and flowering both require precise
  environmental sensing and integrated responses to multiple inputs
  so that developmental transitions can be accurately matched to
  seasonal conditions (1–3). Seeds use temperature as a signal of the
  seasonal and current environmental conditions to determine
  opportune times to germinate with respect to the potential for
  seedling survival (2, 4, 5). Similarly, in many plants the transition
  from vegetative to floral development occurs in response to
  environmental cues, particularly temperature and day length (6, 7).
  Ecological and evolutionary studies have found that seed
  germination and flowering traits within species are coadapted
  across habitat ranges (8–11). Seed dormancy and germination are
  regulated primarily by the antagonistic actions of the plant
  hormones gibberellin (GA; promotive) and abscisic acid (ABA;
  inhibitory), whose synthesis and action vary in response to
  environmental signals (12). Recent studies indicate that canonical
  genes regulating flowering, such as FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and
  FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), are also involved in the transition
  from seed dormancy to germination (13–16), suggesting that seed
  dormancy and flowering may be coordinately regulated through
  overlapping molecular pathways.
  In Arabidopsis, expression of the DELAY OF GERMINATION1 (DOG1)
  gene responds to seed maturation temperature and determines the
  depth of seed dormancy (2, 3, 5, 17–20). Deeper dormancy of
  freshly harvested seeds is associated with high DOG1 transcript
  levels, which decrease in after-ripened (nondormant) and
  germinating seeds (18, 19). Functional analyses have shown that
  DOG1 and ABA are essential for establishing primary seed
  dormancy (18, 19, 21), although DOG1 can act independently of
  ABA to delay germination of less dormant seeds (20).
  Overexpression of DOG1 also increases the sensitivity of seed
  germination to inhibition by warm temperatures (5, 20). In
  addition, genome-wide association and genetic linkage mapping
  studies revealed that the DOG1 locus was associated with flowering
  phenotypes across diverse accessions and locations (22, 23).
  However, the mechanism of DOG1 action on seed dormancy or
  flowering remains unknown.

  Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is a major leafy vegetable derived from a
  progenitor species (Lactuca serriola L.) having a winter annual
  lifecycle, normally flowering in spring after overwintering as a
  compact rosette. Lettuce seeds display little primary dormancy, but
  germination is strongly inhibited by warm temperatures during
  imbibition, a type of relative dormancy termed thermoinhibition
  (24, 25), resulting in reduced crop establishment during warm
  seasons (26). Previously, we genetically mapped and functionally
  characterized the role of L. sativa 9-cis-EPOXYCAROTENOID
  DIOXYGENASE4 (LsNCED4), a gene encoding a key regulated
  enzyme in ABA biosynthesis, in lettuce seed thermoinhibition (24,
  25, 27). Expression of this gene is induced in lettuce seeds by
  imbibition at high temperatures, maintaining high ABA content and
  preventing germination. A similar role was demonstrated for the
  homologous gene Arabidopsis thaliana NCED9 (AtNCED9) (28). The
  mechanism by which these genes are regulated by high temperature
  remains unknown (29).
  Here, we report that suppression of DOG1 expression by RNAi in
  lettuce or mutation of DOG1 in Arabidopsis markedly increased the
  maximum temperature for seed germination. In addition, DOG1RNAi lettuce plants flowered much earlier than control plants.
  Further analyses in lettuce and Arabidopsis showed that these
  phenotypes are associated with reduced conversion of primary
  MIR156 transcript into the microRNA (miRNA) miR156. Effects of
  overexpression of MIR156 on flowering and seed dormancy were
  greatly compromised in loss-of-function dog1-3 mutants of
  Arabidopsis. The expression of several miRNA processing genes was
  altered in seeds of dog1-3 mutants or DOG1-RNAi lines, possibly
  associated with the reduced conversion of MIR156 to miR156. In
  contrast, a gain-of-function dog1-5 mutation that enhanced seed
  dormancy resulted in increased expression of miRNA processing
  genes. As have been described previously for flowering (30, 31) and
  seed and seedling development (32, 33), follow-on effects of
  modification of miR156 levels on miR172 abundance, or direct
  overexpression of MIR172, also affected seed dormancy. Our work
  provides a potential mechanism for DOG1 action and demonstrates
  a previously unknown linkage between seed dormancy and
  flowering phenotypes through a DOG1–miR156–miR172
  interaction.

  DOG1 Influences Seed Thermoinhibition in Lettuce.
  To explore whether lettuce homologs of AtDOG1 are involved in
  regulation of seed thermoinhibition, cDNAs with homology to
  DOG1 were isolated from four genotypes of lettuce having differing
  germination thermotolerance. Seeds of cv. Salinas (L. sativa; termed
  Sal) and PI261653 (Lactuca saligna; termed Saligna) were unable to
  germinate well at 32 °C, whereas seeds of two thermotolerant
  genotypes, accession US96UC23 (L. serriola) and PI251246 (L.
  sativa; termed PI), germinated fully at this temperature (SI
  Appendix, Fig. S1A). Sequences of LsDOG1 cDNAs from the four
  genotypes were highly homologous and shared ∼50% overall
  protein amino acid sequence similarity with Arabidopsis DOG1
  (54.7% similarity within DOG1 domain regions; SI Appendix, Fig. S2
  and Table S1). LsDOG1 is highly expressed in mature lettuce seeds,
  whereas its transcript level is much lower in leaves and roots (SI
  Appendix, Fig. S1C). Its expression in seeds decreased as seed
  maturation temperature increased (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D), as is also
  the case for AtDOG1 expression in Arabidopsis seeds (17, 18).
  Suppression of LsDOG1 expression in Sal lettuce through RNAi
  caused 56% and 73% reductions in transcript abundance in two
  independent lines (Fig. 1A). Seeds of these DOG1-RNAi lines were
  able to germinate fully at 32 °C, whereas seeds of the segregated
  nontransgenic control line (i.e., Sal) were completely inhibited (Fig.
  1 B and C). In contrast, ectopic expression of LsDOG1 under the
  native Sal DOG1 promoter (PDOG1:LsDOG1) in the thermotolerant PI
  lettuce line resulted in increased DOG1 transcripts in mature dry
  seeds and enhanced seed thermoinhibition at 30 °C (Fig. 1 D–F). A
  functional homolog of DOG1 is therefore present in lettuce and is
  involved in regulating germination thermoinhibition.

  imbibed for 30 h. Error bars represent SE (n = 3).
  DOG1 Influences Seed Thermoinhibition in
  Arabidopsis.
  Functional DOG1 action in Arabidopsis promotes seed dormancy and
  extends after-ripening periods required for dormancy alleviation
  (18, 19), whereas fresh seeds of loss-of-function dog1 mutants can
  fully germinate without after-ripening or cold stratification (17,
  19). To test whether DOG1 might be involved in regulating
  germination thermoinhibition in Arabidopsis, we imbibed seeds of
  the Columbia (Col) dog1-3 mutant (Salk_000867) at 32 °C. Mutant
  seeds germinated more than 80% whereas WT seeds germinated
  less than 20% at that temperature (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B).
  Molecular complementation showed that coding regions of LsDOG1
  genes from thermosensitive and thermotolerant lettuce genotypes
  were able to rescue the thermoinhibition phenotype when expressed
  in Arabidopsis dog1-3 plants (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B), indicating that
  these homologs are all functional and that their role in regulation of
  seed thermoinhibition is conserved. The presence of functional
  DOG1 alleles in US96UC23 and PI251246 is consistent with lack of
  association of this locus with quantitative trait loci for hightemperature germination in these genotypes (27, 34).
  Previous work in lettuce and Arabidopsis showed that NCED genes
  encoding a key enzyme in the ABA biosynthetic pathway are
  involved in thermoinhibition of germination (24, 28). We tested the
  interactive effects of DOG1 and ABA on seed thermoinhibition by
  overexpressing LsDOG1 in an atnced6-1 atnced9-1 double mutant
  that displays strong germination thermotolerance as a result of
  reduced ABA biosynthesis (24, 28). Overexpression of LsDOG1
  restored a thermosensitive phenotype to atnced6-1atnced9-1 seeds at
  32 °C (SI Appendix, Fig. S1E), indicating that DOG1 and ABA can
  induce thermoinhibition via parallel pathways. We also generated a
  dog1-3 × nced9-1 double mutant to further examine the interactive
  effect of both genes on thermoinhibition. At a higher temperature
  (35 °C), seeds of the single mutants of dog1-3 and nced9-1 and of the
  double mutant nced6-1 nced9-1 were fully inhibited from
  germinating, whereas dog1-3 nced9-1 seeds germinated 95% (SI

  ## Page 11

  Appendix, Fig. S1F). This additional effect of dog1-3 in the presence
  of ABA biosynthesis mutants is in contrast to reports that ABA
  biosynthesis and functional DOG1 are required for induction of
  primary dormancy (18, 19). However, consistent with previous
  reports (17–20), overexpression of LsDOG1 under the CaMV35S
  promoter in Arabidopsis Col plants resulted in deep seed dormancy
  that could not be alleviated by the ABA biosynthesis inhibitor
  fluridone, but could be alleviated by GA (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
  Thus, DOG1 and ABA can regulate seed primary dormancy and
  thermoinhibition, and may act in concert or independently
  depending on the conditions.
  DOG1 Influences Flowering Time in Lettuce Through
  Effects on miR156.
  Suppression of DOG1 expression in Sal lettuce caused early
  flowering (Fig. 2 A–C), as occurred also in wheat (35). Plants from
  seeds of seven independent transgenic DOG1-RNAi lines that
  germinated at 32 °C and from segregated control (nontransgenic)
  seeds were grown in the greenhouse under relatively noninductive
  day-length conditions for flowering in fall 2013. Salinas DOG1RNAi lines flowered in ∼120–150 d, whereas control lines did not
  flower until >200 d (Fig. 2B). Similar results were observed in two
  DOG1-RNAi lines that were grown in spring 2014, although these
  plants all flowered earlier because of lengthening days (Fig. 2C).

  To assess which flowering regulatory pathways were affected by
  suppression of LsDOG1 expression, transcript levels of key genes in
  the different pathways were investigated (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
  Consistent with early flowering, transcripts of the floral promoter
  FT were almost 25-fold higher in young DOG1-RNAi lettuce leaves
  than in similar leaves of the control line (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
  Expression patterns of other flowering-related genes were not
  consistent with effects on the photoperiod-dependent, GA,
  vernalization, or autonomous flowering pathways (SI Appendix,
  Supplementary Text and Figs. S4 and S5). However, transcripts of
  SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) 3, 4, and 9
  were increased in leaves of the DOG1-RNAi line compared with its
  control line (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Furthermore, the relative mRNA
  levels of SPL3 and 4 were significantly elevated in apical meristems
  of DOG1-RNAi lines, although SPL9 expression was not affected
  (Fig. 2D). SPL gene expression is inhibited by DELLA proteins (SI
  Appendix, Fig. S5), so a decrease in them could result in increased
  SPL expression (36). However, transcripts of genes encoding two
  major DELLA proteins (RGL1 and RGA) were unchanged or elevated
  in DOG1-RNAi leaves (SI Appendix, Fig. S4), making it unlikely that
  this is the cause of increased SPL expression. SPL transcripts are
  targeted for degradation by miR156, a regulator of developmental
  phase transitions in plants, and SPL proteins can induce expression
  of FT and other genes promoting flowering (30). SPLs also promote
  production of miR172, a positive regulator of maturation (juvenile
  to adult) and floral phase transitions (30). Thus, if this mechanism
  is operative, we would expect early flowering and high SPL
  transcript levels to be associated with lower miR156 and higher
  miR172 levels. Consistent with this, miR156 abundance in apical
  meristems of DOG1-RNAi lines was only one third of that in the
  control line, whereas miR172 levels were approximately doubled
  (Fig. 2D). Thus, the early flowering in DOG1-RNAi lettuce plants
  may be a result of a reduction in miR156 levels, which would result
  in increased levels of the floral-promoting SPLs and of miR172 (SI
  Appendix, Fig. S5).
  DOG1 Can Influence Flowering in Arabidopsis.
  In contrast to early flowering when LsDOG1 expression was
  suppressed in lettuce, no effects on flowering times were observed

  ## Page 13

  in Arabidopsis dog1-3 mutant plants under long-day or short-day
  conditions (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S2). However, when
  miR156 levels were elevated by overexpression of the gene
  encoding it, MIR156 (Col-35S:LsMIR156), flowering times were
  significantly delayed (Fig. 3A), with a majority of plants beginning
  to flower more than 50 d after germination (DAG) and having more
  than 36 rosette leaves; in contrast, flowering of homozygous dog1-3
  plants also expressing 35S:LsMIR156 was only slightly delayed
  compared with Col and dog1-3 plants (Table 1 and SI Appendix,
  Table S2). Further evaluation of 48 dog1-3–35S:LsMIR156 and 72
  Col-35S:LsMIR156 independent transgenic lines showed that 87% of
  the former had flowered within 50 DAG and 95% had less than 30
  leaves at flowering, whereas 72% of the latter required more than
  50 d to flower and 83% of flowering lines had more than 30 leaves
  (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S2). Although it is possible that
  sequence homology between the CaMV35S promoter and the TDNA insertion in dog1-3 could silence the transgene (37), this result
  was also reproduced in Landsberg erecta (Ler) and its γ-irradiation–
  induced dog1-1 mutant (19), although the delay in flowering time
  caused by 35S:LsMIR156 in Ler was not as strong as in Col (Table 1
  and SI Appendix, Table S2). As in Arabidopsis, overexpression of
  LsMIR156 also greatly delayed flowering in Sal lettuce (SI Appendix,
  Fig. S6). To test whether this phenomenon is specific to lettuce
  MIR156, we crossed dog1-3 with a Col-35S:AtMIR156 line that
  exhibits delayed flowering (38). Effects on flowering were
  essentially identical to those for LsMIR156 (Fig. 3A, Table 1, and SI
  Appendix, Table S2). The lack of response of dog1-3 plants to
  overexpression of LsMIR156 or AtMIR156 was evidently caused by
  reduced conversion of pri-MIR156 transcripts to miR156, as
  LsMIR156 (or AtMIR156) transcripts were present at equal or
  greater levels in dog1-3 meristems (Fig. 3B and SI Appendix, Fig.
  S7F) or leaves (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A) as in Col tissues also
  expressing LsMIR156 or AtMIR156. The levels of miR156 in dog1-3–
  35S:LsMIR156 meristems were only 28% or 13% of those in 25-dold apical meristems or leaves, respectively, of the
  Col-35S:AtMIR156 plants (Fig. 3B and SI Appendix, Fig. S7B). This
  was associated with an increase in miR172 and SPL3, 4, 5, and 9
  transcripts in dog1-3–35S:LsMIR156 meristems and leaves (Fig. 3B
  and SI Appendix, Fig. S7 C–E). Similar differences in miR156 and
  miR172 levels were also observed in Col and dog1-3 meristems in

  ## Page 14

  were first normalized by AtACT2, and values relative to those in the

  It was recently reported that dog1-5 (SALK_022748) is a gain-offunction mutant in which the level of DOG1 protein is greatly
  increased and seed dormancy is enhanced compared with Col WT
  (39), as we have confirmed here (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). In this case,
  the mutation in DOG1 did not negate the effect of MIR156
  overexpression on delaying flowering, but rather somewhat
  enhanced it; 93% of independent dog1-5-LsMIR156 transgenic lines
  required more than 50 DAG to flower compared with 72% of ColLsMIR156 plants, with similar data for numbers of leaves at
  flowering (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S2). Interestingly, as for
  dog1-3, we did not observe a significant difference in flowering time
  for dog1-5 plants in the absence of MIR156 overexpression (Table 1
  and SI Appendix, Table S1). Thus, in contrast to lettuce, DOG1

  ## Page 17

  regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis is evident only when
  MIR156 expression is enhanced.
  ABA has also been reported to be involved in floral transitions (40),
  raising the question of whether the early flowering observed in
  lettuce DOG1-RNAi plants and dog1-3 plants overexpressing MIR156
  could be caused by the alteration of ABA contents, as mutants in
  ABA biosynthetic genes have similar seed germination phenotypes
  as dog1-3 mutant seeds (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 B and E). However, the
  delayed flowering time phenotypes conferred by 35S:AtMIR156 and
  35S:LsMIR156 in Col plants also occurred in an nced9-1 mutant
  background (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S2). Thus, although
  phenotypic effects of MIR156 overexpression on flowering depend
  upon functional DOG1, expression of NCED9, which is primarily
  seed-expressed and required for thermoinhibition (28), is not
  necessary.
  The results reported here show that loss of DOG1 function
  negatively affects processing of MIR156 to miR156 in lettuce and
  Arabidopsis and elevates miR172 abundance. As miR172 is known
  to promote early flowering in Arabidopsis (30), we tested the effect
  of overexpression of LsMIR172 on flowering in Col WT and dog1-3
  mutant plants. To maximize phenotypic differences, we grew 100
  (for Col-35S:LsMIR172) and 77 (for dog1-3–35S:LsMIR172)
  independent transgenic lines under short-day conditions. Under
  short days, WT Col plants developed more than 40 leaves before
  flowering and 90% of plants did not flower before 90 d, whereas
  85% of Col-35S:MIR172 plants had less than 40 leaves at flowering
  and 39% started flowering in less than 90 DAG (Fig. 3C, Table 1,
  and SI Appendix, Table S2). This advancement of flowering as a
  result of overexpression of MIR172 was much reduced in dog1-3
  plants: more than 60% of dog1-3–35S:LsMIR172 plants had more
  than 40 leaves at flowering, as did the dog1-3 plants, and only 9%
  of dog1-3:35S:LsMIR172 plants flowered in less than 90 DAG (Fig.
  3C, Table 1, and SI Appendix, Table S2). Thus, functional DOG1
  plays a role in the processing or action of MIR172 as well as of
  MIR156 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
  miR156 and miR172 Affect Seed Germination.
  Suppression of DOG1 expression in lettuce, which improved
  germination at warm temperatures (Fig. 1 B and C), also resulted in

  ## Page 18

  large reductions in miR156 content in dry seeds, with levels only 5–
  7% of that in control seeds (Fig. 4A). In mature dog1-3 mutant
  seeds, the miR156 level was slightly lower than that in mature WT
  Col seeds, but this difference was more significant when LsMIR156
  was overexpressed (Fig.4B). We therefore tested whether expression
  of MIR156 and MIR172 would affect primary dormancy and
  thermoinhibition of Arabidopsis seed germination in WT and dog1-3
  mutant plants. Expression of 35S:LsMIR156 or 35S:AtMIR156 in Col
  plants reduced germination at 25 °C, likely reflecting increased
  primary dormancy, and strongly enhanced seed thermoinhibition at
  warmer temperatures (Fig. 4C). In contrast, overexpressing
  LsMIR156 in dog1-3 plants did not affect germination at 25, 30, or
  32 °C (Fig. 4C). Although seeds of the nced9-1 mutant, like dog1-3
  seeds, were thermotolerant, expression of 35S:AtMIR156 in nced9-1
  plants had similar effects in suppressing germination as in Col
  plants (Fig. 4C). This demonstrates that elevation of miR156 can
  inhibit germination independently of seed ABA biosynthesis and
  that the effect of MIR156 expression on seed germination inhibition
  is dependent on functional DOG1. In contrast, overexpression of
  LsMIR172 promoted germination of fresh (primary dormant) Col
  seeds, even at elevated temperatures (Fig. 4D). As dog1-3 seeds did
  not exhibit primary dormancy and germinated fully at all
  temperatures tested, an additional effect of LsMIR172
  overexpression on germination of dog1-3 seeds could not be
  detected (Fig. 4D). Thus, miR156 and miR172 can influence seed
  thermoinhibition as well as flowering and other developmental
  phase transitions (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).

  Altered DOG1 Expression or Function Affects
  Expression of Genes Encoding miRNA Processing
  Proteins.
  As the conversion of primary MIR156 to miR156 was greatly
  compromised in seeds of lettuce DOG1-RNAi suppression lines and
  of Arabidopsis dog1-3 mutants (Fig. 4 A and B), we tested whether
  transcripts of genes encoding proteins associated with miRNA
  transcription or processing were altered. After preliminary
  screening, we focused on five genes: DICER-LIKE 1 (DCL1),
  HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1), the G-patch domain protein
  TOUGH (TGH), the zinc finger protein SERRATE (SE), and CELL
  DIVISION CYCLE 5 (CDC5) that binds RNA polymerase II and MIR
  promoters to positively regulate transcription of MIR-encoding
  genes (41, 42). Although the specific effects varied somewhat
  among the Arabidopsis and lettuce genotypes and mutants tested,
  transcript levels of all of these genes differed from their respective
  WTs in at least some cases (Fig. 4 E–G). For example, the transcript
  levels of DCL1, HYL1, and CDC5 in dry dog1-3 mutant seeds were
  56%, 55%, and 76%, respectively, of those in dry Col WT seeds,
  whereas expression of these genes (and of TGH and SE) was
  elevated compared with Col-WT in seeds of the gain-of-function
  dog1-5 mutant (Fig. 4E). Consistent reduction in expression of these
  genes was also observed in dry seeds of the dog1-1 mutant
  compared with those in Ler-CviDOG1 (Fig. 4F), which contains a
  strong CviDOG1 allele (19), and transcripts of DCL1, SE, TGH, and
  CDC5 were also lower in dry DOG1-RNAi lettuce seeds (Fig. 4G).

  ## Page 20

  These results indicate that DOG1 could affect miR156 (and possibly
  miR172) processing in seeds through altering expression of genes
  encoding miRNA-processing proteins (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
  Discussion
  Seed germination and flowering are two critical developmentalphase transitions in the plant life cycle. Plants sense environmental
  cues such as temperature to coordinate endogenous genetic and
  molecular mechanisms that determine the timing of both phase
  transitions (1, 6, 7, 12, 43, 44). Although its mechanism of action
  remains unknown, DOG1 has been demonstrated to be a positive
  regulator for the establishment and maintenance of primary seed
  dormancy in several species (19, 20, 35). DOG1 is involved in
  transducing maternal environmental conditions during seed
  development into effects on seed dormancy and in the loss of
  dormancy through dry after-ripening or moist chilling (2, 5, 17, 45,
  46). ABA is also a strong positive regulator of seed dormancy (12)
  and promoted DOG1 expression in imbibed Lepidium sativum seeds
  (47). Arabidopsis seeds may require ABA and functional DOG1 to
  establish primary dormancy, as reduced dormancy in Arabidopsis
  seeds was still observed in ABA-deficient aba1 mutants, even when
  the strong Cvi-DOG1 allele was present (18, 19), whereas seeds of a
  dog1-2 cyp707a2-1 double mutant that have higher levels of ABA
  nonetheless exhibited reduced seed dormancy as a result of the loss
  of DOG1 function (18). Here, we demonstrated that DOG1 is
  involved in regulation of thermoinhibition of seed germination in
  lettuce and Arabidopsis, but, unlike the dependence of primary
  dormancy on ABA and DOG1, DOG1 can act in the absence of
  enhanced ABA synthesis to impose thermoinhibition, consistent
  with the relative ineffectiveness of an ABA biosynthesis inhibitor to
  alleviate effects of overexpression of DOG1 on thermoinhibition (SI
  Appendix, Fig. S3) (20). Thus, ABA and DOG1 may regulate seed
  thermoinhibition through parallel but mutually reinforcing
  pathways that may not be identical to those by which they act on
  primary dormancy (29). On the contrary, GA can alleviate the
  effects of overexpression of DOG1 on thermoinhibition (SI Appendix,
  Fig. S3) (20), as might be expected from the suppression of

  ## Page 21

  expression of GA biosynthetic enzymes by high temperatures in
  Arabidopsis and lettuce (25, 28, 34).
  Ecological genetics studies have shown that, under natural seasonal
  variation, DOG1 can influence seed germination and flowering
  times (48). Although, initially, the effects of DOG1 on flowering
  were suggested to be an indirect response to the seasonal timing of
  germination, further study showed that the alleviation of seed
  dormancy resulted in an acceleration of flowering that was
  independent of germination timing (49). Genome-wide association
  and genetic linkage mapping analyses have implicated the DOG1
  locus in the regulation of flowering phenotypes (22, 23), but these
  results were attributed to the possibility of being caused by closely
  linked genes, as DOG1 was assumed to be active only in seeds.
  However, our results demonstrate that DOG1 itself can have effects
  on seed dormancy and flowering, suggesting a more direct
  mechanism for the evolutionary coadaptation of life-cycle
  transitions to match seasonal environmental conditions (16, 44, 49,
  50). In addition, previous studies have shown that genes related to
  flowering are expressed in association with seed development and
  germination. For example, a genome-wide expression correlation
  network in Arabidopsis showed that maturity-phase transition
  regulators such as SE, EMBRYONIC FLOWER1, and EARLY BOLTING
  IN SHORT DAYS are coexpressed with germination-associated genes
  and affect seed germination (14). Arabidopsis HISTONE
  MONOUBIQUITINATION1 and 2 (HUB1 and HUB2) genes regulate
  flowering and seed germination; seeds of hub1 and hub2 mutants
  displayed reduced seed dormancy (51), and hub1 seeds also exhibit
  strong thermotolerance to high temperature at germination (52).
  The increased germination of hub1 and hub2 seeds could be
  attributed to the altered expression of several seed dormancyrelated genes, including DOG1 and NCED9 (51). Loss of function of
  HUB1 and HUB2 also caused early flowering phenotypes through
  repression of FLC by chromatin modification (53). In addition to
  repressing flowering, FLC also promotes seed germination at low
  temperature (10 °C) via changing expression of ABA-catabolism
  (CYP707A2) and GA-biosynthesis (GA20ox1) genes (15). Consistent
  with these observations, the flowering-promotive protein FT
  maternally controls seed dormancy through alteration in seed coat
  tannin content in Arabidopsis (13). Thus, although there have been
  previous indications that seed dormancy and flowering might share

  ## Page 22

  common genetic and molecular mechanisms, our understanding of
  how such mechanisms might be connected to each other and to
  environmental cues has been limited.
  Our results demonstrate that DOG1 regulates seed germination and
  flowering time at least in part through an influence on generation
  and/or action of miR156 and miR172. miRNAs have been
  implicated previously as being involved separately in seed
  germination and flowering time (30, 32). Mutants that are defective
  in DCL1, HYL1, and SE, all of which are required for miRNA
  biogenesis (41), display abnormal flowering and alteration in ABA
  sensitivity of seed germination (54, 55). Interestingly, the delayedflowering phenotype of dcl1-7 mutant could be rescued by
  expression of a DCL4-dependent MIR839 in which the mature
  sequence was replaced by the one encoding MIR172, suggesting
  that the delayed flowering in dcl1-7 plants is a result of the
  reduction in miR172 (56). Earlier transition from the juvenile to the
  adult phase was also observed in loss-of-function mutants of SE and
  HYL1, in association with substantial reduction in miR156, and
  could be rescued by overexpression of MIR156 (57, 58). Another
  miR156 target, SPL13, plays an important role in the regulation of
  the postgerminative switch from the cotyledon stage to the
  vegetative-leaf stage during seedling growth (59). Mutants in dcl1
  exhibit early seed maturation programming, probably caused by
  increased levels of SPL10 and SPL11 as a consequence of reduced
  miR156 (60, 61). Our data indicate that DOG1 may affect the
  conversion of primary MIR156 to miR156 or primary MIR172 to
  miR172 through an effect on expression of genes involved in
  miRNA processing (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Loss of function or gain of
  function of DOG1 decreases or increases, respectively, expression of
  DICER-related genes (Fig. 4 E–G), and previous studies found that
  miR156 and miR172 levels are altered in mutants of DCL1, HYL1,
  SE, TGH, and CDC5 (42, 56, 58, 62, 63). However, multiple
  feedback loops are associated with transcription and processing of
  miRNAs (41), so further study is needed to clarify the specific
  mechanism by which DOG1 affects miRNA levels. In addition, the
  strong effects of DOG1 overexpression in enhancing seed dormancy
  even in the absence of MIR156 overexpression (SI Appendix, Fig. S3)
  (18, 19) indicate that DOG1 may also act on seed germination
  through additional mechanisms (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
  miR156 accumulates to high levels during seed development (32,

  ## Page 23

  64) and is abundant in young seedlings and decreases as plants age,
  in association with the transition to adult phase and flowering (30,
  38, 65). This pattern indicates that high miR156 levels are reset
  during embryogenesis and seed development, as occurs for FLC, a
  strong floral repressor (7). Winter annual flowering plants require
  prolonged chilling to epigenetically silence FLC to flower the next
  spring; to ensure the requirement for vernalization in every
  generation, it is essential to reactivate FLC gene expression during
  seed development (66). Consistent with this, expression and
  maintenance of FLC during late embryogenesis are required for late
  flowering phenotypes (67, 68). Similarly, DOG1 may play a role in
  resetting high miR156 levels during seed development (Fig. 4A),
  and defects in DOG1 function could result in altered
  postgerminative plant development and floral transition as well as
  reduced seed dormancy (SI Appendix, Fig. S5) (32, 41, 64, 65). We
  also note that a primary phenotype of DOG1 action is an extension
  of dry after-ripening times required for dormancy alleviation (19).
  A role for miRNAs produced during seed development in
  maintaining seed dormancy provides a mechanism for the afterripening effect, in which seeds lose dormancy during dry storage
  when metabolism is prevented (12). miR156 accumulation during
  seed development, and its subsequent loss during storage as a result
  of oxidation, as shown for stored mRNAs (69), would provide a
  timing mechanism for after-ripening via loss of the inhibitory effect
  of stored miR156 on germination.
  Our results support the conclusion that the transition from
  dormancy to germination is a life-cycle phase transition comparable
  to vegetative maturation or flowering, and apparently is influenced
  by the same miRNA-dependent systems (SI Appendix, Fig. S5) (32).
  Effects on these systems are also consistent with the hypothesis that
  DOG1 primarily affects the underlying environmental sensitivity of
  processes it influences, rather than directly determining final
  phenotypes (5). As the miR156/SPL/miR172 pathway is involved in
  modulating the inputs from a diverse array of environmental signals
  and transducing them into developmental responses (6, 7, 32, 59),
  interaction of DOG1 with this system would enable it to play an
  integrating role by matching the environmental sensitivities of seed
  dormancy and flowering to current or anticipated conditions. A
  dual role in sensing environmental signals (e.g., temperature) and
  coordinating developmental-phase transitions in the plant life cycle

  ## Page 24

  would explain the repeated identification of DOG1 as a significant
  locus in ecological genetics studies of flowering phenotypes (22, 23,
  48). It would also make evolutionary sense, as seed dormancy and
  germination timing influence the environment in which subsequent
  flowering and reproduction occur, and vice versa (16, 44, 50). An
  integrated mechanism for coordinating these two major life cycle
  transitions having significant impacts on fitness and survival would
  be subject to coselection to optimize (or bet-hedge) both (9, 11, 43,
  49, 50). Much remains to be done to fully understand these
  complex interactions between plant life cycles and the environment,
  but our results demonstrate that DOG1 functions as an important
  molecular integrator that exerts its effects on developmental phase
  changes at least in part through miRNA-regulated pathways.
  Materials and Methods
  Seeds of lettuce (L. sativa L.) were germinated at room temperature
  and then transferred to an automatically controlled greenhouse at
  23 ± 2 °C (day) and 20 ± 2 °C (night) in long days (14 h light/10
  h dark) for seed production unless stated otherwise. Seeds of A.
  thaliana were stratified at 4 °C for 2–4 d before being transferred to
  a growth chamber at 21–22 °C under long days (16 h light/8 h
  dark, 100 or 135 µmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 light intensity) or short days (8 h
  light/16 h dark, 135 µmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 light intensity) for seed
  production. Seeds of the γ-irradiation–induced dog1-1 mutant were
  provided by Leonie Bentsink, Wageningen University, Wageningen,
  The Netherlands (19), seeds of the T-DNA mutant nced9-1 by Eiji
  Nambara, University of Toronto, Toronto, and seeds of the T-DNA
  double-mutant nced6-1 nced9-1 by Annie Marion-Poll, Institut JeanPierre Bourgin, Versailles, France. Seeds of Arabidopsis WT (Col and
  Ler), T-DNA dog1-3 mutant (Salk_000867) (19), T-DNA dog1-5
  mutant (SALK_022748) (39), and AtMIR156-overexpression line
  (CS67849) (30) were purchased from the Arabidopsis Biological
  Resource Center. The dog1-3 mutant line was selfed and genotyped
  for three generations before this study. The Arabidopsis T-DNA
  mutants were genotyped using the primers listed in SI Appendix,
  Table S3. Details of experimental procedures including isolation of
  LsDOG1 and vector construction, generation of dog1-3 ×

  Significance
  Annual plants adapt to their environments by matching their life
  cycles, particularly seed germination and flowering, to the
  appropriate seasons. Although genetic evidence has suggested
  connections among genes regulating seed dormancy and flowering,
  specific mechanisms for such coordination are unknown. We report
  that a gene [DELAY OF GERMINATION1 (DOG1)] involved in
  determining the depth of seed dormancy, and therefore the seasonal
  timing of germination, also influences the timing of flowering in
  Arabidopsis and lettuce. We further show that this gene acts through
  influencing the production of microRNAs that govern the
  progression of developmental phase transitions through the plant
  life cycle, providing a molecular genetic mechanism for the
  coordinate adaptation of seed dormancy and flowering phenotypes

  to environmental conditions.
  Abstract
  Seed germination and flowering, two critical developmental
  transitions in plant life cycles, are coordinately regulated by genetic
  and environmental factors to match plant establishment and
  reproduction to seasonal cues. The DELAY OF GERMINATION1
  (DOG1) gene is involved in regulating seed dormancy in response to
  temperature and has also been associated genetically with
  pleiotropic flowering phenotypes across diverse Arabidopsis thaliana
  accessions and locations. Here we show that DOG1 can regulate
  seed dormancy and flowering times in lettuce (Lactuca sativa, Ls)
  and Arabidopsis through an influence on levels of microRNAs
  (miRNAs) miR156 and miR172. In lettuce, suppression of LsDOG1
  expression enabled seed germination at high temperature and
  promoted early flowering in association with reduced miR156 and
  increased miR172 levels. In Arabidopsis, higher miR156 levels
  resulting from overexpression of the MIR156 gene enhanced seed
  dormancy and delayed flowering. These phenotypic effects, as well
  as conversion of MIR156 transcripts to miR156, were compromised
  in DOG1 loss-of-function mutant plants, especially in seeds.
  Overexpression of MIR172 reduced seed dormancy and promoted
  early flowering in Arabidopsis, and the effect on flowering required
  functional DOG1. Transcript levels of several genes associated with
  miRNA processing were consistently lower in dry seeds of
  Arabidopsis and lettuce when DOG1 was mutated or its expression
  was reduced; in contrast, transcript levels of these genes were
  elevated in a DOG1 gain-of-function mutant. Our results reveal a
  previously unknown linkage between two critical developmental
  phase transitions in the plant life cycle through a DOG1–miR156–
  miR172 interaction.

  The life cycles of flowering plants are characterized by distinct
  phase transitions such as from seed to seedling (germination) or
  from vegetative to reproductive development (flowering) (1). The
  timing of germination and flowering both require precise
  environmental sensing and integrated responses to multiple inputs
  so that developmental transitions can be accurately matched to
  seasonal conditions (1–3). Seeds use temperature as a signal of the
  seasonal and current environmental conditions to determine
  opportune times to germinate with respect to the potential for
  seedling survival (2, 4, 5). Similarly, in many plants the transition
  from vegetative to floral development occurs in response to
  environmental cues, particularly temperature and day length (6, 7).
  Ecological and evolutionary studies have found that seed
  germination and flowering traits within species are coadapted
  across habitat ranges (8–11). Seed dormancy and germination are
  regulated primarily by the antagonistic actions of the plant
  hormones gibberellin (GA; promotive) and abscisic acid (ABA;
  inhibitory), whose synthesis and action vary in response to
  environmental signals (12). Recent studies indicate that canonical
  genes regulating flowering, such as FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and
  FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), are also involved in the transition
  from seed dormancy to germination (13–16), suggesting that seed
  dormancy and flowering may be coordinately regulated through
  overlapping molecular pathways.
  In Arabidopsis, expression of the DELAY OF GERMINATION1 (DOG1)
  gene responds to seed maturation temperature and determines the
  depth of seed dormancy (2, 3, 5, 17–20). Deeper dormancy of
  freshly harvested seeds is associated with high DOG1 transcript
  levels, which decrease in after-ripened (nondormant) and
  germinating seeds (18, 19). Functional analyses have shown that
  DOG1 and ABA are essential for establishing primary seed
  dormancy (18, 19, 21), although DOG1 can act independently of
  ABA to delay germination of less dormant seeds (20).
  Overexpression of DOG1 also increases the sensitivity of seed
  germination to inhibition by warm temperatures (5, 20). In
  addition, genome-wide association and genetic linkage mapping
  studies revealed that the DOG1 locus was associated with flowering
  phenotypes across diverse accessions and locations (22, 23).
  However, the mechanism of DOG1 action on seed dormancy or
  flowering remains unknown.

  ## Page 8

  Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is a major leafy vegetable derived from a
  progenitor species (Lactuca serriola L.) having a winter annual
  lifecycle, normally flowering in spring after overwintering as a
  compact rosette. Lettuce seeds display little primary dormancy, but
  germination is strongly inhibited by warm temperatures during
  imbibition, a type of relative dormancy termed thermoinhibition
  (24, 25), resulting in reduced crop establishment during warm
  seasons (26). Previously, we genetically mapped and functionally
  characterized the role of L. sativa 9-cis-EPOXYCAROTENOID
  DIOXYGENASE4 (LsNCED4), a gene encoding a key regulated
  enzyme in ABA biosynthesis, in lettuce seed thermoinhibition (24,
  25, 27). Expression of this gene is induced in lettuce seeds by
  imbibition at high temperatures, maintaining high ABA content and
  preventing germination. A similar role was demonstrated for the
  homologous gene Arabidopsis thaliana NCED9 (AtNCED9) (28). The
  mechanism by which these genes are regulated by high temperature
  remains unknown (29).
  Here, we report that suppression of DOG1 expression by RNAi in
  lettuce or mutation of DOG1 in Arabidopsis markedly increased the
  maximum temperature for seed germination. In addition, DOG1RNAi lettuce plants flowered much earlier than control plants.
  Further analyses in lettuce and Arabidopsis showed that these
  phenotypes are associated with reduced conversion of primary
  MIR156 transcript into the microRNA (miRNA) miR156. Effects of
  overexpression of MIR156 on flowering and seed dormancy were
  greatly compromised in loss-of-function dog1-3 mutants of
  Arabidopsis. The expression of several miRNA processing genes was
  altered in seeds of dog1-3 mutants or DOG1-RNAi lines, possibly
  associated with the reduced conversion of MIR156 to miR156. In
  contrast, a gain-of-function dog1-5 mutation that enhanced seed
  dormancy resulted in increased expression of miRNA processing
  genes. As have been described previously for flowering (30, 31) and
  seed and seedling development (32, 33), follow-on effects of
  modification of miR156 levels on miR172 abundance, or direct
  overexpression of MIR172, also affected seed dormancy. Our work
  provides a potential mechanism for DOG1 action and demonstrates
  a previously unknown linkage between seed dormancy and
  flowering phenotypes through a DOG1–miR156–miR172
  interaction.

  DOG1 Influences Seed Thermoinhibition in Lettuce.
  To explore whether lettuce homologs of AtDOG1 are involved in
  regulation of seed thermoinhibition, cDNAs with homology to
  DOG1 were isolated from four genotypes of lettuce having differing
  germination thermotolerance. Seeds of cv. Salinas (L. sativa; termed
  Sal) and PI261653 (Lactuca saligna; termed Saligna) were unable to
  germinate well at 32 °C, whereas seeds of two thermotolerant
  genotypes, accession US96UC23 (L. serriola) and PI251246 (L.
  sativa; termed PI), germinated fully at this temperature (SI
  Appendix, Fig. S1A). Sequences of LsDOG1 cDNAs from the four
  genotypes were highly homologous and shared ∼50% overall
  protein amino acid sequence similarity with Arabidopsis DOG1
  (54.7% similarity within DOG1 domain regions; SI Appendix, Fig. S2
  and Table S1). LsDOG1 is highly expressed in mature lettuce seeds,
  whereas its transcript level is much lower in leaves and roots (SI
  Appendix, Fig. S1C). Its expression in seeds decreased as seed
  maturation temperature increased (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D), as is also
  the case for AtDOG1 expression in Arabidopsis seeds (17, 18).
  Suppression of LsDOG1 expression in Sal lettuce through RNAi
  caused 56% and 73% reductions in transcript abundance in two
  independent lines (Fig. 1A). Seeds of these DOG1-RNAi lines were
  able to germinate fully at 32 °C, whereas seeds of the segregated
  nontransgenic control line (i.e., Sal) were completely inhibited (Fig.
  1 B and C). In contrast, ectopic expression of LsDOG1 under the
  native Sal DOG1 promoter (PDOG1:LsDOG1) in the thermotolerant PI
  lettuce line resulted in increased DOG1 transcripts in mature dry
  seeds and enhanced seed thermoinhibition at 30 °C (Fig. 1 D–F). A
  functional homolog of DOG1 is therefore present in lettuce and is
  involved in regulating germination thermoinhibition.

  DOG1 Influences Seed Thermoinhibition in
  Arabidopsis.
  Functional DOG1 action in Arabidopsis promotes seed dormancy and
  extends after-ripening periods required for dormancy alleviation
  (18, 19), whereas fresh seeds of loss-of-function dog1 mutants can
  fully germinate without after-ripening or cold stratification (17,
  19). To test whether DOG1 might be involved in regulating
  germination thermoinhibition in Arabidopsis, we imbibed seeds of
  the Columbia (Col) dog1-3 mutant (Salk_000867) at 32 °C. Mutant
  seeds germinated more than 80% whereas WT seeds germinated
  less than 20% at that temperature (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B).
  Molecular complementation showed that coding regions of LsDOG1
  genes from thermosensitive and thermotolerant lettuce genotypes
  were able to rescue the thermoinhibition phenotype when expressed
  in Arabidopsis dog1-3 plants (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B), indicating that
  these homologs are all functional and that their role in regulation of
  seed thermoinhibition is conserved. The presence of functional
  DOG1 alleles in US96UC23 and PI251246 is consistent with lack of
  association of this locus with quantitative trait loci for hightemperature germination in these genotypes (27, 34).
  Previous work in lettuce and Arabidopsis showed that NCED genes
  encoding a key enzyme in the ABA biosynthetic pathway are
  involved in thermoinhibition of germination (24, 28). We tested the
  interactive effects of DOG1 and ABA on seed thermoinhibition by
  overexpressing LsDOG1 in an atnced6-1 atnced9-1 double mutant
  that displays strong germination thermotolerance as a result of
  reduced ABA biosynthesis (24, 28). Overexpression of LsDOG1
  restored a thermosensitive phenotype to atnced6-1atnced9-1 seeds at
  32 °C (SI Appendix, Fig. S1E), indicating that DOG1 and ABA can
  induce thermoinhibition via parallel pathways. We also generated a
  dog1-3 × nced9-1 double mutant to further examine the interactive
  effect of both genes on thermoinhibition. At a higher temperature
  (35 °C), seeds of the single mutants of dog1-3 and nced9-1 and of the
  double mutant nced6-1 nced9-1 were fully inhibited from
  germinating, whereas dog1-3 nced9-1 seeds germinated 95% (SI

  ## Page 11

  Appendix, Fig. S1F). This additional effect of dog1-3 in the presence
  of ABA biosynthesis mutants is in contrast to reports that ABA
  biosynthesis and functional DOG1 are required for induction of
  primary dormancy (18, 19). However, consistent with previous
  reports (17–20), overexpression of LsDOG1 under the CaMV35S
  promoter in Arabidopsis Col plants resulted in deep seed dormancy
  that could not be alleviated by the ABA biosynthesis inhibitor
  fluridone, but could be alleviated by GA (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
  Thus, DOG1 and ABA can regulate seed primary dormancy and
  thermoinhibition, and may act in concert or independently
  depending on the conditions.
  DOG1 Influences Flowering Time in Lettuce Through
  Effects on miR156.
  Suppression of DOG1 expression in Sal lettuce caused early
  flowering (Fig. 2 A–C), as occurred also in wheat (35). Plants from
  seeds of seven independent transgenic DOG1-RNAi lines that
  germinated at 32 °C and from segregated control (nontransgenic)
  seeds were grown in the greenhouse under relatively noninductive
  day-length conditions for flowering in fall 2013. Salinas DOG1RNAi lines flowered in ∼120–150 d, whereas control lines did not
  flower until >200 d (Fig. 2B). Similar results were observed in two
  DOG1-RNAi lines that were grown in spring 2014, although these
  plants all flowered earlier because of lengthening days (Fig. 2C).
  Fig. 2.

  levels were first normalized by LsUBQ10 and are shown relative to
  those in control for each gene or miRNA. Error bars represent SE (n
  = 3).

  ## Page 12

  To assess which flowering regulatory pathways were affected by
  suppression of LsDOG1 expression, transcript levels of key genes in
  the different pathways were investigated (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
  Consistent with early flowering, transcripts of the floral promoter
  FT were almost 25-fold higher in young DOG1-RNAi lettuce leaves
  than in similar leaves of the control line (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
  Expression patterns of other flowering-related genes were not
  consistent with effects on the photoperiod-dependent, GA,
  vernalization, or autonomous flowering pathways (SI Appendix,
  Supplementary Text and Figs. S4 and S5). However, transcripts of
  SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) 3, 4, and 9
  were increased in leaves of the DOG1-RNAi line compared with its
  control line (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Furthermore, the relative mRNA
  levels of SPL3 and 4 were significantly elevated in apical meristems
  of DOG1-RNAi lines, although SPL9 expression was not affected
  (Fig. 2D). SPL gene expression is inhibited by DELLA proteins (SI
  Appendix, Fig. S5), so a decrease in them could result in increased
  SPL expression (36). However, transcripts of genes encoding two
  major DELLA proteins (RGL1 and RGA) were unchanged or elevated
  in DOG1-RNAi leaves (SI Appendix, Fig. S4), making it unlikely that
  this is the cause of increased SPL expression. SPL transcripts are
  targeted for degradation by miR156, a regulator of developmental
  phase transitions in plants, and SPL proteins can induce expression
  of FT and other genes promoting flowering (30). SPLs also promote
  production of miR172, a positive regulator of maturation (juvenile
  to adult) and floral phase transitions (30). Thus, if this mechanism
  is operative, we would expect early flowering and high SPL
  transcript levels to be associated with lower miR156 and higher
  miR172 levels. Consistent with this, miR156 abundance in apical
  meristems of DOG1-RNAi lines was only one third of that in the
  control line, whereas miR172 levels were approximately doubled
  (Fig. 2D). Thus, the early flowering in DOG1-RNAi lettuce plants
  may be a result of a reduction in miR156 levels, which would result
  in increased levels of the floral-promoting SPLs and of miR172 (SI
  Appendix, Fig. S5).
  DOG1 Can Influence Flowering in Arabidopsis.
  In contrast to early flowering when LsDOG1 expression was
  suppressed in lettuce, no effects on flowering times were observed

  ## Page 13

  in Arabidopsis dog1-3 mutant plants under long-day or short-day
  conditions (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S2). However, when
  miR156 levels were elevated by overexpression of the gene
  encoding it, MIR156 (Col-35S:LsMIR156), flowering times were
  significantly delayed (Fig. 3A), with a majority of plants beginning
  to flower more than 50 d after germination (DAG) and having more
  than 36 rosette leaves; in contrast, flowering of homozygous dog1-3
  plants also expressing 35S:LsMIR156 was only slightly delayed
  compared with Col and dog1-3 plants (Table 1 and SI Appendix,
  Table S2). Further evaluation of 48 dog1-3–35S:LsMIR156 and 72
  Col-35S:LsMIR156 independent transgenic lines showed that 87% of
  the former had flowered within 50 DAG and 95% had less than 30
  leaves at flowering, whereas 72% of the latter required more than
  50 d to flower and 83% of flowering lines had more than 30 leaves
  (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S2). Although it is possible that
  sequence homology between the CaMV35S promoter and the TDNA insertion in dog1-3 could silence the transgene (37), this result
  was also reproduced in Landsberg erecta (Ler) and its γ-irradiation–
  induced dog1-1 mutant (19), although the delay in flowering time
  caused by 35S:LsMIR156 in Ler was not as strong as in Col (Table 1
  and SI Appendix, Table S2). As in Arabidopsis, overexpression of
  LsMIR156 also greatly delayed flowering in Sal lettuce (SI Appendix,
  Fig. S6). To test whether this phenomenon is specific to lettuce
  MIR156, we crossed dog1-3 with a Col-35S:AtMIR156 line that
  exhibits delayed flowering (38). Effects on flowering were
  essentially identical to those for LsMIR156 (Fig. 3A, Table 1, and SI
  Appendix, Table S2). The lack of response of dog1-3 plants to
  overexpression of LsMIR156 or AtMIR156 was evidently caused by
  reduced conversion of pri-MIR156 transcripts to miR156, as
  LsMIR156 (or AtMIR156) transcripts were present at equal or
  greater levels in dog1-3 meristems (Fig. 3B and SI Appendix, Fig.
  S7F) or leaves (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A) as in Col tissues also
  expressing LsMIR156 or AtMIR156. The levels of miR156 in dog1-3–
  35S:LsMIR156 meristems were only 28% or 13% of those in 25-dold apical meristems or leaves, respectively, of the
  Col-35S:AtMIR156 plants (Fig. 3B and SI Appendix, Fig. S7B). This
  was associated with an increase in miR172 and SPL3, 4, 5, and 9
  transcripts in dog1-3–35S:LsMIR156 meristems and leaves (Fig. 3B
  and SI Appendix, Fig. S7 C–E). Similar differences in miR156 and
  miR172 levels were also observed in Col and dog1-3 meristems in

  ## Page 14

  response to overexpression of AtMIR156 (SI Appendix, Fig. S7F).

  were first normalized by AtACT2, and values relative to those in the

  bars represent SE (n = 3). (C) Col-35S:LsMIR172 and dog1-3–

  It was recently reported that dog1-5 (SALK_022748) is a gain-offunction mutant in which the level of DOG1 protein is greatly
  increased and seed dormancy is enhanced compared with Col WT
  (39), as we have confirmed here (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). In this case,
  the mutation in DOG1 did not negate the effect of MIR156
  overexpression on delaying flowering, but rather somewhat
  enhanced it; 93% of independent dog1-5-LsMIR156 transgenic lines
  required more than 50 DAG to flower compared with 72% of ColLsMIR156 plants, with similar data for numbers of leaves at
  flowering (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S2). Interestingly, as for
  dog1-3, we did not observe a significant difference in flowering time
  for dog1-5 plants in the absence of MIR156 overexpression (Table 1
  and SI Appendix, Table S1). Thus, in contrast to lettuce, DOG1

  ## Page 17

  regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis is evident only when
  MIR156 expression is enhanced.
  ABA has also been reported to be involved in floral transitions (40),
  raising the question of whether the early flowering observed in
  lettuce DOG1-RNAi plants and dog1-3 plants overexpressing MIR156
  could be caused by the alteration of ABA contents, as mutants in
  ABA biosynthetic genes have similar seed germination phenotypes
  as dog1-3 mutant seeds (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 B and E). However, the
  delayed flowering time phenotypes conferred by 35S:AtMIR156 and
  35S:LsMIR156 in Col plants also occurred in an nced9-1 mutant
  background (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Table S2). Thus, although
  phenotypic effects of MIR156 overexpression on flowering depend
  upon functional DOG1, expression of NCED9, which is primarily
  seed-expressed and required for thermoinhibition (28), is not
  necessary.
  The results reported here show that loss of DOG1 function
  negatively affects processing of MIR156 to miR156 in lettuce and
  Arabidopsis and elevates miR172 abundance. As miR172 is known
  to promote early flowering in Arabidopsis (30), we tested the effect
  of overexpression of LsMIR172 on flowering in Col WT and dog1-3
  mutant plants. To maximize phenotypic differences, we grew 100
  (for Col-35S:LsMIR172) and 77 (for dog1-3–35S:LsMIR172)
  independent transgenic lines under short-day conditions. Under
  short days, WT Col plants developed more than 40 leaves before
  flowering and 90% of plants did not flower before 90 d, whereas
  85% of Col-35S:MIR172 plants had less than 40 leaves at flowering
  and 39% started flowering in less than 90 DAG (Fig. 3C, Table 1,
  and SI Appendix, Table S2). This advancement of flowering as a
  result of overexpression of MIR172 was much reduced in dog1-3
  plants: more than 60% of dog1-3–35S:LsMIR172 plants had more
  than 40 leaves at flowering, as did the dog1-3 plants, and only 9%
  of dog1-3:35S:LsMIR172 plants flowered in less than 90 DAG (Fig.
  3C, Table 1, and SI Appendix, Table S2). Thus, functional DOG1
  plays a role in the processing or action of MIR172 as well as of
  MIR156 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
  miR156 and miR172 Affect Seed Germination.
  Suppression of DOG1 expression in lettuce, which improved
  germination at warm temperatures (Fig. 1 B and C), also resulted in

  ## Page 18

  large reductions in miR156 content in dry seeds, with levels only 5–
  7% of that in control seeds (Fig. 4A). In mature dog1-3 mutant
  seeds, the miR156 level was slightly lower than that in mature WT
  Col seeds, but this difference was more significant when LsMIR156
  was overexpressed (Fig.4B). We therefore tested whether expression
  of MIR156 and MIR172 would affect primary dormancy and
  thermoinhibition of Arabidopsis seed germination in WT and dog1-3
  mutant plants. Expression of 35S:LsMIR156 or 35S:AtMIR156 in Col
  plants reduced germination at 25 °C, likely reflecting increased
  primary dormancy, and strongly enhanced seed thermoinhibition at
  warmer temperatures (Fig. 4C). In contrast, overexpressing
  LsMIR156 in dog1-3 plants did not affect germination at 25, 30, or
  32 °C (Fig. 4C). Although seeds of the nced9-1 mutant, like dog1-3
  seeds, were thermotolerant, expression of 35S:AtMIR156 in nced9-1
  plants had similar effects in suppressing germination as in Col
  plants (Fig. 4C). This demonstrates that elevation of miR156 can
  inhibit germination independently of seed ABA biosynthesis and
  that the effect of MIR156 expression on seed germination inhibition
  is dependent on functional DOG1. In contrast, overexpression of
  LsMIR172 promoted germination of fresh (primary dormant) Col
  seeds, even at elevated temperatures (Fig. 4D). As dog1-3 seeds did
  not exhibit primary dormancy and germinated fully at all
  temperatures tested, an additional effect of LsMIR172
  overexpression on germination of dog1-3 seeds could not be
  detected (Fig. 4D). Thus, miR156 and miR172 can influence seed
  thermoinhibition as well as flowering and other developmental
  phase transitions (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).

  Altered DOG1 Expression or Function Affects
  Expression of Genes Encoding miRNA Processing
  Proteins.
  As the conversion of primary MIR156 to miR156 was greatly
  compromised in seeds of lettuce DOG1-RNAi suppression lines and
  of Arabidopsis dog1-3 mutants (Fig. 4 A and B), we tested whether
  transcripts of genes encoding proteins associated with miRNA
  transcription or processing were altered. After preliminary
  screening, we focused on five genes: DICER-LIKE 1 (DCL1),
  HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1), the G-patch domain protein
  TOUGH (TGH), the zinc finger protein SERRATE (SE), and CELL
  DIVISION CYCLE 5 (CDC5) that binds RNA polymerase II and MIR
  promoters to positively regulate transcription of MIR-encoding
  genes (41, 42). Although the specific effects varied somewhat
  among the Arabidopsis and lettuce genotypes and mutants tested,
  transcript levels of all of these genes differed from their respective
  WTs in at least some cases (Fig. 4 E–G). For example, the transcript
  levels of DCL1, HYL1, and CDC5 in dry dog1-3 mutant seeds were
  56%, 55%, and 76%, respectively, of those in dry Col WT seeds,
  whereas expression of these genes (and of TGH and SE) was
  elevated compared with Col-WT in seeds of the gain-of-function
  dog1-5 mutant (Fig. 4E). Consistent reduction in expression of these
  genes was also observed in dry seeds of the dog1-1 mutant
  compared with those in Ler-CviDOG1 (Fig. 4F), which contains a
  strong CviDOG1 allele (19), and transcripts of DCL1, SE, TGH, and
  CDC5 were also lower in dry DOG1-RNAi lettuce seeds (Fig. 4G).

  These results indicate that DOG1 could affect miR156 (and possibly
  miR172) processing in seeds through altering expression of genes
  encoding miRNA-processing proteins (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
  Discussion
  Seed germination and flowering are two critical developmentalphase transitions in the plant life cycle. Plants sense environmental
  cues such as temperature to coordinate endogenous genetic and
  molecular mechanisms that determine the timing of both phase
  transitions (1, 6, 7, 12, 43, 44). Although its mechanism of action
  remains unknown, DOG1 has been demonstrated to be a positive
  regulator for the establishment and maintenance of primary seed
  dormancy in several species (19, 20, 35). DOG1 is involved in
  transducing maternal environmental conditions during seed
  development into effects on seed dormancy and in the loss of
  dormancy through dry after-ripening or moist chilling (2, 5, 17, 45,
  46). ABA is also a strong positive regulator of seed dormancy (12)
  and promoted DOG1 expression in imbibed Lepidium sativum seeds
  (47). Arabidopsis seeds may require ABA and functional DOG1 to
  establish primary dormancy, as reduced dormancy in Arabidopsis
  seeds was still observed in ABA-deficient aba1 mutants, even when
  the strong Cvi-DOG1 allele was present (18, 19), whereas seeds of a
  dog1-2 cyp707a2-1 double mutant that have higher levels of ABA
  nonetheless exhibited reduced seed dormancy as a result of the loss
  of DOG1 function (18). Here, we demonstrated that DOG1 is
  involved in regulation of thermoinhibition of seed germination in
  lettuce and Arabidopsis, but, unlike the dependence of primary
  dormancy on ABA and DOG1, DOG1 can act in the absence of
  enhanced ABA synthesis to impose thermoinhibition, consistent
  with the relative ineffectiveness of an ABA biosynthesis inhibitor to
  alleviate effects of overexpression of DOG1 on thermoinhibition (SI
  Appendix, Fig. S3) (20). Thus, ABA and DOG1 may regulate seed
  thermoinhibition through parallel but mutually reinforcing
  pathways that may not be identical to those by which they act on
  primary dormancy (29). On the contrary, GA can alleviate the
  effects of overexpression of DOG1 on thermoinhibition (SI Appendix,
  Fig. S3) (20), as might be expected from the suppression of

  ## Page 21

  expression of GA biosynthetic enzymes by high temperatures in
  Arabidopsis and lettuce (25, 28, 34).
  Ecological genetics studies have shown that, under natural seasonal
  variation, DOG1 can influence seed germination and flowering
  times (48). Although, initially, the effects of DOG1 on flowering
  were suggested to be an indirect response to the seasonal timing of
  germination, further study showed that the alleviation of seed
  dormancy resulted in an acceleration of flowering that was
  independent of germination timing (49). Genome-wide association
  and genetic linkage mapping analyses have implicated the DOG1
  locus in the regulation of flowering phenotypes (22, 23), but these
  results were attributed to the possibility of being caused by closely
  linked genes, as DOG1 was assumed to be active only in seeds.
  However, our results demonstrate that DOG1 itself can have effects
  on seed dormancy and flowering, suggesting a more direct
  mechanism for the evolutionary coadaptation of life-cycle
  transitions to match seasonal environmental conditions (16, 44, 49,
  50). In addition, previous studies have shown that genes related to
  flowering are expressed in association with seed development and
  germination. For example, a genome-wide expression correlation
  network in Arabidopsis showed that maturity-phase transition
  regulators such as SE, EMBRYONIC FLOWER1, and EARLY BOLTING
  IN SHORT DAYS are coexpressed with germination-associated genes
  and affect seed germination (14). Arabidopsis HISTONE
  MONOUBIQUITINATION1 and 2 (HUB1 and HUB2) genes regulate
  flowering and seed germination; seeds of hub1 and hub2 mutants
  displayed reduced seed dormancy (51), and hub1 seeds also exhibit
  strong thermotolerance to high temperature at germination (52).
  The increased germination of hub1 and hub2 seeds could be
  attributed to the altered expression of several seed dormancyrelated genes, including DOG1 and NCED9 (51). Loss of function of
  HUB1 and HUB2 also caused early flowering phenotypes through
  repression of FLC by chromatin modification (53). In addition to
  repressing flowering, FLC also promotes seed germination at low
  temperature (10 °C) via changing expression of ABA-catabolism
  (CYP707A2) and GA-biosynthesis (GA20ox1) genes (15). Consistent
  with these observations, the flowering-promotive protein FT
  maternally controls seed dormancy through alteration in seed coat
  tannin content in Arabidopsis (13). Thus, although there have been
  previous indications that seed dormancy and flowering might share

  ## Page 22

  common genetic and molecular mechanisms, our understanding of
  how such mechanisms might be connected to each other and to
  environmental cues has been limited.
  Our results demonstrate that DOG1 regulates seed germination and
  flowering time at least in part through an influence on generation
  and/or action of miR156 and miR172. miRNAs have been
  implicated previously as being involved separately in seed
  germination and flowering time (30, 32). Mutants that are defective
  in DCL1, HYL1, and SE, all of which are required for miRNA
  biogenesis (41), display abnormal flowering and alteration in ABA
  sensitivity of seed germination (54, 55). Interestingly, the delayedflowering phenotype of dcl1-7 mutant could be rescued by
  expression of a DCL4-dependent MIR839 in which the mature
  sequence was replaced by the one encoding MIR172, suggesting
  that the delayed flowering in dcl1-7 plants is a result of the
  reduction in miR172 (56). Earlier transition from the juvenile to the
  adult phase was also observed in loss-of-function mutants of SE and
  HYL1, in association with substantial reduction in miR156, and
  could be rescued by overexpression of MIR156 (57, 58). Another
  miR156 target, SPL13, plays an important role in the regulation of
  the postgerminative switch from the cotyledon stage to the
  vegetative-leaf stage during seedling growth (59). Mutants in dcl1
  exhibit early seed maturation programming, probably caused by
  increased levels of SPL10 and SPL11 as a consequence of reduced
  miR156 (60, 61). Our data indicate that DOG1 may affect the
  conversion of primary MIR156 to miR156 or primary MIR172 to
  miR172 through an effect on expression of genes involved in
  miRNA processing (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Loss of function or gain of
  function of DOG1 decreases or increases, respectively, expression of
  DICER-related genes (Fig. 4 E–G), and previous studies found that
  miR156 and miR172 levels are altered in mutants of DCL1, HYL1,
  SE, TGH, and CDC5 (42, 56, 58, 62, 63). However, multiple
  feedback loops are associated with transcription and processing of
  miRNAs (41), so further study is needed to clarify the specific
  mechanism by which DOG1 affects miRNA levels. In addition, the
  strong effects of DOG1 overexpression in enhancing seed dormancy
  even in the absence of MIR156 overexpression (SI Appendix, Fig. S3)
  (18, 19) indicate that DOG1 may also act on seed germination
  through additional mechanisms (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
  miR156 accumulates to high levels during seed development (32,

  ## Page 23

  64) and is abundant in young seedlings and decreases as plants age,
  in association with the transition to adult phase and flowering (30,
  38, 65). This pattern indicates that high miR156 levels are reset
  during embryogenesis and seed development, as occurs for FLC, a
  strong floral repressor (7). Winter annual flowering plants require
  prolonged chilling to epigenetically silence FLC to flower the next
  spring; to ensure the requirement for vernalization in every
  generation, it is essential to reactivate FLC gene expression during
  seed development (66). Consistent with this, expression and
  maintenance of FLC during late embryogenesis are required for late
  flowering phenotypes (67, 68). Similarly, DOG1 may play a role in
  resetting high miR156 levels during seed development (Fig. 4A),
  and defects in DOG1 function could result in altered
  postgerminative plant development and floral transition as well as
  reduced seed dormancy (SI Appendix, Fig. S5) (32, 41, 64, 65). We
  also note that a primary phenotype of DOG1 action is an extension
  of dry after-ripening times required for dormancy alleviation (19).
  A role for miRNAs produced during seed development in
  maintaining seed dormancy provides a mechanism for the afterripening effect, in which seeds lose dormancy during dry storage
  when metabolism is prevented (12). miR156 accumulation during
  seed development, and its subsequent loss during storage as a result
  of oxidation, as shown for stored mRNAs (69), would provide a
  timing mechanism for after-ripening via loss of the inhibitory effect
  of stored miR156 on germination.
  Our results support the conclusion that the transition from
  dormancy to germination is a life-cycle phase transition comparable
  to vegetative maturation or flowering, and apparently is influenced
  by the same miRNA-dependent systems (SI Appendix, Fig. S5) (32).
  Effects on these systems are also consistent with the hypothesis that
  DOG1 primarily affects the underlying environmental sensitivity of
  processes it influences, rather than directly determining final
  phenotypes (5). As the miR156/SPL/miR172 pathway is involved in
  modulating the inputs from a diverse array of environmental signals
  and transducing them into developmental responses (6, 7, 32, 59),
  interaction of DOG1 with this system would enable it to play an
  integrating role by matching the environmental sensitivities of seed
  dormancy and flowering to current or anticipated conditions. A
  dual role in sensing environmental signals (e.g., temperature) and
  coordinating developmental-phase transitions in the plant life cycle

  ## Page 24

  would explain the repeated identification of DOG1 as a significant
  locus in ecological genetics studies of flowering phenotypes (22, 23,
  48). It would also make evolutionary sense, as seed dormancy and
  germination timing influence the environment in which subsequent
  flowering and reproduction occur, and vice versa (16, 44, 50). An
  integrated mechanism for coordinating these two major life cycle
  transitions having significant impacts on fitness and survival would
  be subject to coselection to optimize (or bet-hedge) both (9, 11, 43,
  49, 50). Much remains to be done to fully understand these
  complex interactions between plant life cycles and the environment,
  but our results demonstrate that DOG1 functions as an important
  molecular integrator that exerts its effects on developmental phase
  changes at least in part through miRNA-regulated pathways.
  Materials and Methods
  Seeds of lettuce (L. sativa L.) were germinated at room temperature
  and then transferred to an automatically controlled greenhouse at
  23 ± 2 °C (day) and 20 ± 2 °C (night) in long days (14 h light/10
  h dark) for seed production unless stated otherwise. Seeds of A.
  thaliana were stratified at 4 °C for 2–4 d before being transferred to
  a growth chamber at 21–22 °C under long days (16 h light/8 h
  dark, 100 or 135 µmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 light intensity) or short days (8 h
  light/16 h dark, 135 µmol⋅m−2⋅s−1 light intensity) for seed
  production. Seeds of the γ-irradiation–induced dog1-1 mutant were
  provided by Leonie Bentsink, Wageningen University, Wageningen,
  The Netherlands (19), seeds of the T-DNA mutant nced9-1 by Eiji
  Nambara, University of Toronto, Toronto, and seeds of the T-DNA
  double-mutant nced6-1 nced9-1 by Annie Marion-Poll, Institut JeanPierre Bourgin, Versailles, France. Seeds of Arabidopsis WT (Col and
  Ler), T-DNA dog1-3 mutant (Salk_000867) (19), T-DNA dog1-5
  mutant (SALK_022748) (39), and AtMIR156-overexpression line
  (CS67849) (30) were purchased from the Arabidopsis Biological
  Resource Center. The dog1-3 mutant line was selfed and genotyped
  for three generations before this study. The Arabidopsis T-DNA

  Abstract

  ## Page 8

  The xoxF gene, encoding a pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent
  methanol dehydrogenase, is found in all known proteobacterial
  methylotrophs. In several newly discovered methylotrophs, XoxF is
  the active methanol dehydrogenase, catalysing the oxidation of
  methanol to formaldehyde. Apart from that, its potential role in
  methylotrophy and carbon cycling is unknown. So far, the diversity
  of xoxF in the environment has received little attention. We
  designed PCR primer sets targeting clades of the xoxF gene, and
  used 454 pyrosequencing of PCR amplicons obtained from the DNA
  of four coastal marine environments for a unique assessment of the
  diversity of xoxF in these habitats. Phylogenetic analysis of the data
  obtained revealed a high diversity of xoxF genes from two of the
  investigated clades, and substantial differences in sequence
  composition between environments. Sequences were classified as
  being related to a wide range of both methylotrophs and nonmethylotrophs from Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and
  Gammaproteobacteria. The most prominent sequences detected
  were related to the family Rhodobacteraceae, the genus
  Methylotenera and the OM43 clade of Methylophilales, and are thus
  related to organisms that employ XoxF for methanol oxidation.
  Furthermore, our analyses revealed a high degree of so far
  undescribed sequences, suggesting a high number of unknown
  bacterial species in these habitats.

  Abstract
  Methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) catalyzes the first step in methanol
  use by methylotrophic bacteria and the second step in methane
  conversion by methanotrophs. Gram-negative bacteria possess an
  MDH with pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as its catalytic center.
  This MDH belongs to the broad class of eight-bladed β propeller
  quinoproteins, which comprise a range of other alcohol and
  aldehyde dehydrogenases. A well-investigated MDH is the
  heterotetrameric MxaFI-MDH, which is composed of two large
  catalytic subunits (MxaF) and two small subunits (MxaI). MxaFIMDHs bind calcium as a cofactor that assists PQQ in catalysis.
  Genomic analyses indicated the existence of another MDH distantly
  related to the MxaFI-MDHs. Recently, several of these so-called
  XoxF-MDHs have been isolated. XoxF-MDHs described thus far are
  homodimeric proteins lacking the small subunit and possess a rareearth element (REE) instead of calcium. The presence of such REE
  may confer XoxF-MDHs a superior catalytic efficiency. Moreover,
  XoxF-MDHs are able to oxidize methanol to formate, rather than to
  formaldehyde as MxaFI-MDHs do. While structures of MxaFI- and
  XoxF-MDH are conserved, also regarding the binding of PQQ, the
  accommodation of a REE requires the presence of a specific

  ## Page 8

  aspartate residue near the catalytic site. XoxF-MDHs containing
  such REE-binding motif are abundantly present in genomes of
  methylotrophic and methanotrophic microorganisms and also in
  organisms that hitherto are not known for such lifestyle. Moreover,
  sequence analyses suggest that XoxF-MDHs represent only a small
  part of putative REE-containing quinoproteins, together covering an
  unexploited potential of metabolic functions.

  Abstract

  ## Page 8

  The mechanism by which pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-
  dependent methanol dehydrogenases (MDH), bearing either a Ca2+
  or a lanthanide (Ln3+) ion in their active site, oxidize methanol has
  been intensely debated. In particular, the Ln3+-dependent activity
  of Ln-MDH remains poorly understood. The lack of experimental
  evidence represents a significant limitation to improve our
  understanding of these enzymes. In this work, we propose that
  insights on Ca- and Ln-MDH reactivity can be gained by examining
  a model reaction, the hydration of PQQ. Indeed, this reaction is
  similar to the first step of the putative methanol additionelimination mechanism and is expected to be similarly influenced
  by the metal ion. The apparent affinity constants of PQQ for Ca2+
  and Ln3+ were determined by UVvis absorption spectroscopy. LnPQQ complexes in aqueous solution were analyzed by steady-state
  and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The thermodynamic
  and kinetic parameters describing the equilibrium were obtained by
  variable-temperature and proton exchange spectroscopy (EXSY)
  NMR, as well as DFT calculations. Results demonstrated a Lndependent exchange rate for PQQ hydration equilibrium, the late
  and more Lewis acidic Ln3+ having the stronger impact.
  Keywords: Exchange rate constant; Hydration reaction; Lanthanide
  complexes; Methanol dehydrogenases; Pyrroloquinoline quinone.

  Abstract
  The impact of periplasmic localisation on the functioning of the
  XoxF protein was evaluated in the well-studied dichloromethaneutilising methylotroph Methylorubrum extorquens DM4, which
  harbors only one paralogue of the xoxF gene. It was found that the
  cytoplasmic targeting of XoxF by expression of the corresponding
  gene without the sequence encoding the N-terminal signal peptide
  does not impair the activation and lanthanide-dependent regulation
  of the MxaFI-methanol dehydrogenase genes. Analysis of the
  viability of ΔxoxF cells complemented with the full-length and
  truncated xoxF gene also showed that the expression of
  cytoplasmically targeted XoxF even increases the resistance to acids.
  These results contradict the proposed function of the XoxF protein

  ## Page 8

  as an extracytoplasmic signal sensor. At the same time, the
  observed dynamics of growth with methanol, as well as with
  dichloromethane of strains expressing cytoplasmic-targeted XoxF,
  indicate the probable enzymatic activity of lanthanide-dependent
  methanol dehydrogenase in this compartment. Herewith, the only
  available substrate for this enzyme in cells growing with
  dichloromethane was formaldehyde, which is produced during the
  primary metabolism of the mentioned halogenated toxicant directly
  in the cytosol. These findings suggest that the maturation of XoxFmethanol dehydrogenase may occur already in the cytoplasm, while
  the factors changing affinity of this enzyme for formaldehyde are
  apparently absent there. Together with the demonstrated
  functioning of an enhancer-like upstream activating sequence in the
  promoter region of the xoxF gene in M. extorquens DM4, the
  obtained information enriches our understanding of the regulation,
  synthesis and role of the XoxF protein.
  Keywords: Aerobic methylotrophic bacteria; Dichloromethane;
  Enhancer-like upstream activating sequence; Ln3+-dependent

  Abstract
  Although synthetic biology can produce valuable chemicals in a
  renewable manner, its progress is still hindered by a lack of
  predictive capabilities. Media optimization is a critical, and often
  overlooked, process which is essential to obtain the titers, rates and
  yields needed for commercial viability. Here, we present a
  molecule- and host-agnostic active learning process for media

  optimization that is enabled by a fast and highly repeatable semiautomated pipeline. Its application yielded 60% and 70% increases
  in titer, and 350% increase in process yield in three different
  campaigns for flaviolin production in Pseudomonas putida KT2440.
  Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques pinpointed that,
  surprisingly, common salt (NaCl) is the most important component
  influencing production. The optimal salt concentration is very high,
  comparable to seawater and close to the limits that P. putida can
  tolerate. The availability of fast Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL)
  cycles allowed us to show that performance improvements for
  active learning are rarely monotonous. This work illustrates how
  machine learning and automation can change the paradigm of
  current synthetic biology research to make it more effective and
  informative, and suggests a cost-effective and underexploited
  strategy to facilitate the high titers, rates and yields essential for
  commercial viability.

  Introduction
  Although synthetic biology can produce valuable chemicals in a
  renewable manner, its progress is still hindered by a lack of
  predictive capabilities1,2,3. Synthetic biology has allowed us to
  produce, e.g., synthetic silk for clothing4, meat-tasting meatless
  burgers using bioengineered heme5, and antimalarial and
  anticancer drugs6,7. Furthermore, it has the potential to play a
  significant role in tackling climate change by enabling a circular
  bioeconomy8,9,10,11, and in producing novel therapeutic drugs12.
  Its prospects are auspicious thanks to the availability of new tools
  for genetic editing, high-throughput phenotypic data generation13,
  and a growing demand for renewable products14. However, our
  inability to predict the outcome of engineering interventions often
  pushes synthetic biologists to an arduous and time consuming trialand-error search for the optimal strain and cultivation
  conditions1,15.
  Media optimization is a critical step in the synthetic biology process
  that could significantly benefit from predictive capabilities16,17.
  Media optimization involves finding the optimal media providing
  the largest production levels, and is essential to obtain the high
  titers, rates, and yields (TRY) that are often required for commercial
  viability18. This step is often relegated to the process optimization
  phase at scale-up (e.g., from 1–2 ml to 1–2 L), when all genome
  engineering is considered finished, because it can be very
  cumbersome. Indeed, the traditional and most popular approach to
  optimize media involves experimentally changing one component at
  a time, often based on biological knowledge of the host. This
  approach can be very time consuming for a typical media if testing
  all components: e.g., traditionally 10 components at 5 levels of
  concentration would require 50 experiments when tested one
  component at a time. Testing the combination of these would
  require 510 experiments. It can also be ineffective if only testing a
  few components and our biological knowledge does not pinpoint
  relevant media components, and fails to consider non-linear effects
  (e.g., the optimal concentration of component X may be different
  once component Y is changed). Moreover, this traditional approach

  ## Page 6

  overlooks the opportunity for co-optimization of pathway, host, and
  media, which can significantly improve TRY results. Indeed, it has
  been shown that the optimal media for one clone can be very
  different than for another clone, producing differences in
  production as large as 70%16,19.
  Because of the limitations of the traditional approach to media
  optimization, more sophisticated approaches have been used,
  although sparsely: these include Design of Experiment (DoE) and
  machine learning (ML). DoE approaches16, fitting the response to
  second degree polynomials using Response Surface Methodology
  (RSM), have been used on P. putida to improve phenazine-1carboxylic acid production20, siderophore production21,
  biosurfactant production22 as well as arginine deaminase activity23,
  with varying degrees of success. RSM has also been used for media
  optimization in other organisms, such as to increase 2,3,5,6Tetramethylpyrazine in Corynebacterium glutamicum24. Neural
  networks have been shown to outperform RSM in similar tasks25,26.
  ML has also been used to predict production of a metabolite of
  interest from media composition: the optimal media for the
  production of tyrosine and 4-aminophenylalanine in E. coli was
  found not to be optimal for growth27, and production of rifamycin
  B in Amycolatopsis mediterranei28 was increased by 25% testing a
  hundred different media compositions. These efforts show the
  effectiveness of machine learning models to predict performance
  based on media composition, yet the need for large datasets to train
  these models makes it prohibitive for fields where access to
  materials is limited or experiments are costly.
  The significant cost of the large data sets needed to train ML
  algorithms prompts the use of active learning processes, in which
  ML algorithms select which data to collect. Active learning29 uses
  ML in an iterative process in which the algorithm chooses the next
  set of experiments to be performed (i.e., the next set of instances to
  be “labeled”). This approach increases data efficiency dramatically,
  minimizing the number of experiments that need to be performed to
  reach the desired goal (e.g., increase production). To date, we only
  know of two pioneering studies that use active learning to optimize
  media, and neither attempted to improve synthesis of a product.
  Zhang et al.30 tried to improve growth rate and growth yield in

  ## Page 7

  Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus plantarum, and Hashizume et al.31
  optimized cell viability for mammalian HeLa-S3 cells using the
  cellular abundance of NAD(P)H as a proxy. However, both of these
  studies required a supercomputer to handle the approximately 10
  million candidate media combinations considered, making it
  inaccessible to most researchers with no access to large
  computational resources.
  Flaviolin and Pseudomonas putida are an interesting target
  metabolite and host pair for production because of the metabolite’s
  nature as precursor to a very diverse family of compounds, and the
  organism’s versatile metabolism. Flaviolin has numerous
  applications in the biomanufacturing space. In general terms,
  flaviolin can be used as a proxy for malonyl-CoA, a precursor to
  polyketides and fatty acids, which have applications in the synthesis
  of fuels32, materials33, and pharmaceuticals34. Flaviolin is also used
  directly in the chemical synthesis of the napyradiomycins35, known
  for their antimicrobial and anticancer activities36,37. Furthermore,
  it can be easily quantified through absorbance measurements: we
  have previously demonstrated its utility as a reporter for assaying
  the effect of glucose on Type-III polyketide biosynthesis38. P. putida
  displays strong tolerance to solvents and the ability to degrade
  aromatic compounds from lignocellulosic materials39, a potentially
  very large source of carbon40.
  Here, we present a semi-automated active learning process able to
  optimize the culture media for production of a desired metabolite
  (Fig. 1), which we demonstrated on P. putida producing flaviolin.
  The approach, however, is agnostic to the molecule and host, so it is
  applicable to any other organisms and products. To feed the
  machine learning algorithm (the Automated Recommendation Tool,
  ART41) the data it needs, we created a highly repeatable, semiautomated pipeline able to test up to fifteen media combinations in
  just three days, requiring less than four hours hands-on time. The
  active learning process guided by ART produced increases of 60%
  and 70% in titer, and 350% in process yield in three different
  campaigns. Furthermore, the use of explainable Artificial
  Intelligence (AI) techniques pinpointed that only five of the media
  components strongly influenced production and, surprisingly,
  common salt (NaCl) was the most important. Interestingly, the

  ## Page 8

  optimal salt concentration for flaviolin production is very high,
  comparable to seawater and close to the limits that P. putida can
  tolerate. Leveraging the fast Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL3,42)
  cycles provided by the semi-automated pipeline, we were able to
  explore the behavior of active learning processes when multiple
  DBTL cycles are available, and showed that improvements in
  performance are rarely monotonous. By using synthetic data, we
  also showed that ART outperforms other state of the art approaches
  when leading the active learning process, embodying the highlyeffective machine learning algorithm needed to effectively explore
  very large phase spaces. This work provides an illustrative example
  of how machine learning can be productively leveraged to
  accelerate and improve the biological engineering process, and
  suggests a cost-effective and underexploited strategy to facilitate the
  high TRYs essential for commercial viability.

  Given a strain and a media formulation (with [A], [B], [C]…
  concentrations for components A, B, C…) that results in a certain
  production of a desired metabolite, our semi-automated pipeline
  leverages automation, DoE, and machine learning to find the
  combination of media component concentrations (i.e., media
  design) that optimizes final production. Hence, this pipeline
  facilitates and automates one of the most cumbersome processes in
  synthetic biology. Moreover, the pipeline is generally applicable to
  any strain and metabolite, and can be easily translated to a cloud
  lab or fully automated to create a self-driving lab because of the
  standard hardware used and the detailed protocol provided in this
  paper. For this case, our media was composed of fifteen components
  (based on MOPS minimal medium, Table S1), out of which three
  components were held fixed (glucose, MOPS and Tricine), except
  for the yield improvement case (when glucose was unconstrained).
  We optimized the media to increase production of flaviolin, a
  precursor to a very diverse family of compounds, in P. putida., an
  organism of versatile metabolism. Figure created using Biorender80.

  Results and Discussion
  Development of a semi-automated data generation
  pipeline provided the data quality required for
  machine learning to be effective
  Since abundant high-quality data is critical for machine learning
  methods to be fully predictive1, we invested time in developing a
  semi-automated pipeline able to test up to 15 media designs in
  triplicate/quadruplicate in a period of three days (Fig. 2, S1).
  Toward this goal, we automated most steps of the media
  optimization process. To begin with, an automated liquid handler
  combined stock solutions for each of the 15 media components (2–3
  fixed, 12–13 variables, Fig. 1) to create media with the desired
  concentrations for each (i.e., a media design). Then, these media
  designs were dispensed in three or four wells of a 48-well plate,
  inoculated with the engineered P. putida strain, and cultivated in an
  automated cultivation platform. After a 48 hour cultivation,
  flaviolin in the culture supernatant was measured in a microplate
  reader using absorbance at 340 nm as a proxy. These flaviolin
  production data and the media designs were stored in the
  Experiment Data Depot (EDD43). ART collected these data from
  EDD and used them to recommend improved media designs. These
  media designs, combined with the stock concentrations, were used
  to generate the liquid handler instructions for media preparation
  through a Jupyter notebook. These instructions were provided to
  the liquid handler along with stock solutions to build the desired
  media design, starting a new cycle. The BioLector was chosen for
  cultivation because of its automated nature, the reproducibility of
  its data through tight control of culture conditions (O2 transfer,
  shake speed, humidity), and its ability to produce results that scale
  to higher volumes44. In the end, media optimization in small wells
  is of limited use unless the results can be scaled to the higher
  volumes where production will take place. The microplate reader
  was used because our product, flaviolin, has light absorption
  properties that can be measured optically, accelerating phenotype
  acquisition with respect to other methods (HPLC, GC-MS, etc). In
  this way, we used the Abs340 as a high-throughput assay to
  effectively guide the active learning process, and we used the HPLC

  ## Page 10

  assay to validate the increases with an authoritative assay. This
  approach has been reported previously in Yang et al.45, where
  flaviolin was used as a Malonyl-CoA biosensor and the optimal
  wavelength for measurement was determined to be λ = 340 nm,
  even though maximum absorbance is at λ = ~300 nm. Final results
  were confirmed with HPLC (Fig. S2). To enable reproducibility
  through a standardized protocol description and transfer, the full
  protocol has been stored in protocols.io46.

  high quality data that machine learning needs in order to
  effectively guide the engineering process.

  A Media is synthesized in a BioMek NXP (Beckman Coulter) liquid
  handler, and is used to culture a flaviolin-producing P. putida strain
  in the Biolector Pro (Beckman) automated cultivation platform. The
  amount of flaviolin is assayed through its absorbance (Abs340) in a
  microplate reader (Spectramax M2), and the corresponding data is
  uploaded to the Experiment Data Depot (EDD). ART pulls the data
  from EDD, trains on these data to develop a predictive model for
  flaviolin production (response) from the media component
  concentrations (input), and uses that model to recommend the
  media design (concentrations for all 12-13 variable components of
  the media) for the next cultivation. ART’s media design
  recommendations are transformed into instructions for the BioMek
  liquid handler through a Jupyter notebook (See Supplementary
  Fig. S1 for a more detailed description). The 48 wells in the
  Biolector were used to test either 15 or 11 media designs per DBTL
  cycle. If using three replicates, 15 media designs and one control
  could be tested (48/3 = 16 = 15+1 control); if using four
  replicates, 11 media designs and one control could be tested (48/4
  = 12 = 11+1 control). Each DBTL cycle takes three days to run (1
  day for sample prep + 2 day cultivations), providing a convenient
  setup to test the effect of multiple DBTL cycles. B ART takes as
  input the concentrations of media components and as response the
  flaviolin titer (or yield), creates a model to predict response from
  inputs, and uses it to produce recommendations. Figure generated
  using Biorender80.

  This semi-automated pipeline could be fully automated and
  converted into a self-driving lab47, or transferred to a cloud
  lab48,49, because it has been designed with that purpose in mind.
  The human labor required in this process involved the transport of
  strains and samples, preparation of inoculum culture, preparation of
  concentrated media component stock solutions, and centrifugation
  of cultures after production. Media preparation, inoculation, and
  arraying of culture supernatant into a 48-well plate were all carried
  out using the automated liquid handler. A fully automated platform
  could employ a powder handler to automate the preparation of
  stock solutions, and other automated liquid handlers could perform
  the centrifugation. An automated robotic arm50 could transport
  strains and samples from one station to another. Complementarily,
  the whole process could be deployed in a cloud lab, eliminating all
  hands-on labor for the researcher. Furthermore, this method could
  be further expanded to enable quantification of metabolites
  requiring more sophisticated preparation, like extractions or
  lyophilization.
  Repeatability is a key element for ML to be effective, and was tested
  in three ways: within a cycle (Fig. 3), between cycles (Fig. 4B) and
  between users (Fig. S3). For each cycle and media design, we built
  three to four replicates of the same media (Fig. 2). We arrived at
  this number after building a full plate of 48 replicates for a test
  media, and finding that 3-4 replicates produced an error (coefficient
  of variation) typically less than 10% (Fig. 3, S4). To check
  repeatability between cycles, we added a control to each DBTL
  cycle (with its corresponding replicates) representing the initial
  media formulation (MOPS minimal medium). We purposefully
  added 10% noise to the replicates of these controls’ media designs
  to ensure the robustness of the model, and to test the sensitivity of
  flaviolin production to each component concentration. As evidence
  of the repeatability that automation enabled, we observed that,
  after five to six cycles, the control medium showed no changes in
  flaviolin production above the 10% base noise level (black dots in
  Fig. 4B). Lastly, to ensure robustness of the automated pipeline to
  user differences (i.e. reproducibility), different users repeated the
  exact same protocol with the same media designs using freshly

  ## Page 12

  made stocks after a full year. The results were quite reproducible
  (Fig. S3), indicating that this process could be transferred to a
  different environment and maintain reproducibility.
  Fig. 3: The semi-automated pipeline produces replicable data.

  The figures represent the 48 wells in a Biolector for DBTL cycles 1
  and 2 in the first campaign. In each row (A–F) the columns 1–4
  contain the same media design (technical replicates), and so do
  columns 5–8. The four wells in the lower right part of the plate (F
  5-8) always contain the same control medium (plus a 10% added
  noise), to ensure that results can be replicated for different DBTL
  cycles. Notice how the production levels for replicates are very
  similar, typically with less than 10% error (Fig. S4). This
  repeatability is essential for machine learning methods to be
  effective. Any spurious deviation can produce significant deviations
  in predictions and recommendations.

  148% increase in titer during campaign 1.
  [image]
  A The first 2 DBTL cycles were designed using Latin Hypercube
  Sampling (LHS) to explore as much of the phase space as possible.
  These were followed by 3 DBTL cycles, where in each cycle ART
  was trained on the data of the previous cycles, and generated
  recommendations which either maximized the variance of the
  output of the probabilistic model to find regions with the highest
  prediction uncertainty (exploration), or maximized the mean of the
  output of the probabilistic model to find media designs with the
  highest predicted flaviolin titer (exploitation). DBTL 1-2 contained
  each media design in four replicates. Due to high reproducibility,
  we decreased the number of replicates to 3 for DBTL 3-5, enabling
  more experiments to fit on the plate. B The cross-validated
  predictions for the first two DBTL cycles showed limited predictive
  power (R2 = 0.32). However, recommendations produced from this
  data improved the titer proxy (Abs340) by 148% in DBTL 3. DBTL 4
  and 5 did not show any improvement, but the model predictive

  ## Page 13

  power increased significantly in DBTL 4 with a coefficient of
  determination (R2) reaching as high as 0.83. The fraction of
  exploitation (red) vs exploration (orange) recommendations
  increased as DBTL cycles progressed. Results for the control media
  (in black) for all previous DBTL cycles are included for each DBTL
  cycle, showing that they stay within 10% of each other (coefficient
  of variation = 0.067), and demonstrating repeatability between
  cycles. The same information for campaigns 2 and 3 can be found in
  Fig. S5.
  Full size image
  Applying the pipeline produced significant
  improvements in flaviolin production
  We leveraged the semi-automated platform to perform three
  campaigns (C1, C2, C3, with 5-6 DBTL cycles each) and improve the
  titers and process yields of flaviolin production by 60% (148% as
  measured by Abs340), 70% (170% in Abs340) and 350% (300% in
  Abs340) respectively (Fig. 4, Fig. S5). The first two campaigns, C1
  and C2, aimed to increase the flaviolin titer proxy (Abs340) while
  keeping the glucose concentration at the same level as our baseline
  media. For the third campaign, C3, we aimed to increase the
  process yield proxy (i.e., ratio of flaviolin proxy divided by the
  initial glucose concentration, see Materials and Methods) after
  unconstraining the glucose concentration. All three campaigns
  converged to similar regions of the media phase space, even though
  the explored trajectory was different (Fig. 5). Indeed, the most
  successful media designs for each campaign were very similar, and
  displayed unexpectedly high levels of NaCl (close to the limits that
  P. putida can tolerate, Fig. S6). We evaluated the predictive
  accuracy of the model by using the coefficient of determination R2,
  which represents the fraction of the response data variance
  explained by the model51. A value close to one indicates very good
  predictions (almost all response data explained by the model), and
  values close to zero or negative indicate no predictive power.
  Hence, a higher value of R2 is desirable because it implies a higher
  capability to predict flaviolin production from the media
  component concentrations, which is critical to find the media
  component concentrations that maximize production.

  Fig. 5: All three active learning campaigns converged to similar
  regions of the media phase space.

  The media phase space is a multidimensional space in which each
  possible media design corresponds to one unique point in the phase
  space. Each metabolite concentration corresponds to a coordinate
  axis. Due to the inherent difficulty of visualizing high dimensional
  spaces, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize
  the most important dimensions (along which there is maximum
  variation). This PCA shows that high performing media,
  recommended in the final DBTL cycles, lie in the same region of the
  phase space (red rectangle), primarily along the same value for PC1.
  Panels A, B, and C show compositions colored by DBTL cycle, while
  Panels D, E, and F show compositions colored by flaviolin
  production levels. Each campaign is represented by a pair of panels:
  (A, D): Campaign 1, titer maximization, (B, E): Campaign 2, titer
  maximization, and (C, F): Campaign 3, process yield maximization.
  The two first principal components explain 43% of the total
  variance. A 3D PCA is shown in Fig. S7, capturing 52% of the total
  variance.
  Full size image
  All three campaigns were performed similarly: two DBTL cycles
  using DoE approaches, followed by three to four DBTL cycles of
  active learning guided by ART (Fig. 4, Fig. S5). DBTL cycles 1-2
  were used to accumulate sufficient training data to make ART
  effective in predicting production from media composition. For this
  purpose, we used a DoE approach called Latin Hypercube Sampling
  (LHS), included in ART41. LHS does not leverage any prior
  biological knowledge other than the components used and their
  upper and lower bounds, and is a purely statistical approach
  producing recommendations meant to span as much phase space as
  possible, since ML algorithms are typically much more effective for
  interpolating than extrapolating. After DBTL 1 and 2, an active
  learning process ensued, in which we used all the previously
  generated data from the prior DBTL cycles to train ART (e.g.
  training for DBTL 4 of C1 used the data from DBTL 1-3 of C1), and
  generated recommendations for the next DBTL cycle (Fig. 2). These

  ## Page 15

  initial 23-31 datapoints were enough to generate effective
  recommendations. For example, in C1 the highest performing media
  designs was suggested in DBTL3, from a model trained only on 23
  media designs. In this active learning process we progressively
  shifted from an emphasis in exploration to exploitation. Explorative
  recommendations focused on investigating parts of the media phase
  space where ART’s predictive power was most limited, whereas
  exploitative recommendations focused on suggesting new media
  designs that were predicted to yield the highest response41. We
  expected that ART would be able to identify high-producing media
  designs more accurately as a larger fraction of the media phase
  space was experimentally explored. As an example of this
  progressive shift from exploration to exploitation, in DBTL 3 from
  C2, 66% of the recommendations were explorative and 33%
  exploitative. In DBTL 4, however, 46% were explorative and 54%
  exploitative, and in DBTL 5, 33% were explorative and 66%
  exploitative (Table S2). Due to the time and monetary cost of
  biological experiments we limited the number of DBTL cycles
  performed in this study to numbers that are practical. Hence, we
  aimed to conduct 5 DBTL cycles per campaign. However, if we saw
  improvements at DBTL5, we would conduct further experiments
  until there was no further increase in the maximization objective
  for that campaign.
  The first campaign (C1, Fig. 4) generated media designs that
  improved titer by 148%, as measured by the proxy, and 70% when
  measured directly (through HPLC), starting at a production of ~95 
  mg/l flaviolin. The active learning process in C1 started with
  limited predictive power at the end of DBTL cycle 2 (R2 = 0.32),
  but was able to provide recommendations that produced in DBTL 3
  the highest titer increase for the whole campaign. Predictive power
  increased significantly for DBTL 4 and 5 (R2 = 0.83 and 0.75,
  resp.), but no further titer increases were found. DBTL cycles 1-2 of
  C1 used four replicates for each media design, instead of three used
  in DBTL 3-5 (Fig. 4), reducing the number of media designs
  (instances) produced relative to the initial DBTL cycles, and limiting
  the starting predictive power. As in the other campaigns, the
  repeatable titer results for all controls in all DBTL cycles (Fig. 4B)
  are a testament to the pipeline’s excellent repeatability (Fig. 2).

  ## Page 16

  Campaign two (C2, Fig. S5) produced a higher improvement than
  C1, increasing titer by 170%, as measured by the proxy, and 60%
  when measured directly, starting at a production of ~95 mg/l
  flaviolin. This campaign was performed to check the reproducibility
  of our results when a key member of the team left the institution, a
  common occurrence in research environments. C2 mimicked C1
  except in the number of replicates used: three for all cycles instead
  of four for the initial two DBTL cycles in C1. The results in C1 had
  shown that three replicates were enough to capture the variability,
  and this change increased the number of media designs per DBTL
  cycle: from 12 (11 designs + 1 control) to 16 (15 designs + 1
  control). We expected this increase in instances to improve the
  predictive ability of ART at each cycle. Indeed, the active learning
  process started with a much stronger predictive power than in C1
  (R2 = 0.64), but provided no increase in titer in DBTL cycles 3 and
  4. It was only in DBTL 5 that the 170% increase in titer proxy was
  observed, along with slowly increasing predictive power (R2 = 
  0.70). A DBTL 5 was performed with no further increase in titer,
  and the campaign was considered finished. However, the fact that
  predictive power decreased and remained around R2 = 0.68
  indicates that ART still did not yet have a thorough knowledge of
  the full phase space, and there may be areas of improved
  performance.
  Optimizing for flaviolin process yield instead of titer generated an
  impressive 300% improvement of the proxy in campaign three (C3),
  and a 350% increase in direct flaviolin yield, starting from a yield
  of 0.025 (flaviolin (g) / glucose (g)) in the initial media (Fig. S5).
  This campaign used three replicates as well, providing good
  predictive power (R2 = 0.63) to start the active learning process.
  There were no increases in DBTL 3, but DBTL 4 brought an increase
  of proxy yield of 300%, and the predictive power rose to the
  highest observed in this project, R2 = 0.89. A final DBTL 5 provided
  no further increases and the campaign was finished, showcasing a
  very respectable R2 = 0.86 for predicting yield. A trade-off between
  titer and yield is common in production strains, and a similar one
  between titer and process yield was found in this case (Fig. 6A):
  higher initial glucose concentrations improved titer and decreased
  yield, and vice versa. Further, a more unusual strong positive
  correlation of yield and titer on NaCl concentration was observed

  ## Page 17

  (Fig. 6B), in agreement with our observations in C1 and C2. Using
  these dependencies, it is possible to efficiently select yield and titer
  by choosing the right initial glucose and NaCl concentrations. While
  performing active learning to increase yield we observed a media
  design that shows a good compromise between titer and yield
  (shaded square area in Fig. 6B). This media design was
  recommended by ART for DBTL 4, showing an 80% increase in titer
  and an 100% increase in yield from the control media.
  Fig. 6: Glucose concentration controls the tradeoff between
  titer and process yield, while salt determines the performance
  of the media designs in campaign 3.

  A The media designs with the highest yield showed low titer, and
  vice-versa. B In either case, titer and yield were generally positively
  affected by higher salt concentration. Shaded square area represents
  a media design that shows a good compromise between titer and
  yield. Abs340 is a proxy for flaviolin titer.
  Full size image
  All three campaigns converged to the same region of phase space
  (Fig. 5, Fig. S7), which displayed surprisingly high levels of NaCl
  (Fig. S6). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the
  active learning process in C1 and C3 followed a very similar
  trajectory in all cycles (Fig. 5A,C), despite different objectives. A
  divergence occurred in C2 after DBTL 3, however, that led to a
  different trajectory. Despite this difference, the best media designs
  were found in the same region of phase space at the end of the
  active learning process. The media corresponding to the highest
  production generally displayed concentrations of most media
  components 2-16 times higher than for the base media, with the
  NaCl concentration ten times higher (Fig. S6). This NaCl
  concentration (at 460 mM) is close to the limit of what P. putida can
  tolerate52,53,54. Whereas other components (e.g., (NH4)6Mo7O24)
  also displayed large concentration increases in the optimal media
  for all three campaigns, their impact in the production of flaviolin
  was minor, as evidenced by the feature importance analysis
  described in the next section.

  ## Page 18

  The improvements in titer and process yield during the active
  learning process seem to be abrupt and unpredictable, rather than
  gradual. These improvements may happen when the predictive
  power is high (C3, DBTL 5, R2 = 0.63, Fig. S5) or low (C1, DBTL 3,
  R2 = 0.32, Fig. 4B), and they may happen with few instances (C1,
  DBTL 3, 23 instances, Fig. 4B) or many (C2, DBTL 5, 61 instances,
  Fig. S5). Hence, the lack of increased production in a given cycle
  does not, in any way, mean that those increases would not occur in
  future cycles. For this reason, it is difficult to categorically affirm
  that any of these titers or yields cannot be improved in the future.
  Indeed, the good, but not ideal, nature of our predictions at the end
  of the campaigns (R2 = 0.75, 0.68, 0.86 for C1, C3, and C3),
  indicates that ART does not yet have a perfect predictive knowledge
  of titer or yield, and there could be remaining phase space pockets
  where they could be increased.
  Feature importance analysis shows that salt stress is
  the main driver of enhanced production
  Only five out of the twelve variable components (thirteen for C3,
  including glucose concentration) of the media were found to play
  important roles in flaviolin production (Fig. 7, S8, S9): NaCl,
  K2HPO4, K2SO4, FeSO4, and NH4Cl. K2HPO4 is the sole source of
  phosphate in our starting medium (MOPS minimal medium), while
  buffering is done using MOPS and Tricine buffers. K2SO4 and FeSO4
  are the sulfate and iron sources, while NH4Cl is the sole nitrogen
  source in our media composition. NaCl provides sodium to the
  bacteria and also strongly regulates metabolism. Feature
  importance was determined through SHapley Additive exPlanations
  (SHAP) analysis55, which compares the model output when a given
  feature is included or excluded (i.e., setting its value to the average
  of all observations). This process is performed for all possible
  features and feature combinations, with the final SHAP value being
  the sum of all individual feature contributions.
  Fig. 7: Feature importance for Campaign 1 shows that salts
  concentrations are the main drivers of production
  improvement.
  [image]

  ## Page 19

  SHAP values, indicating impact of the feature on the response,
  indicate that the top five of the components are the most important
  (SHAP values for other components are much lower). NaCl
  concentration in particular has the highest impact on the predicted
  production. High SHAP values indicate high impact in increasing
  response, whereas low SHAP values indicate high impact in
  decreasing response. Colors indicate the value of the feature for the
  corresponding SHAP value. Hence high values of NaCl
  concentration produce high values of flaviolin titer, whereas high
  values of K2SO4 produce low values of flaviolin titer. Similar SHAP
  analyses for campaigns 2 and 3 can be found in Figs. S8 and S9.
  SHAP values are in units of the response (Abs340, Fig. 2).
  Full size image
  Surprisingly, the salt NaCl emerged as the most critical feature
  overall influencing flaviolin production (Fig. 7, S8, S9). NaCl
  ranked first in feature importance for campaigns C1 and C2, and
  second for C3 (with glucose being the most important, as expected).
  In all three campaigns, the best-performing media contained 8-9.2
  times the concentration in the starting media (400-460 mM NaCl,
  Fig. S6). The consistency between the final results of three
  independent campaigns (Fig. 5), the feature importance analysis
  (Fig. 7), and the distinct effect of NaCl on flaviolin production
  (Fig. 6B) underscore the importance of NaCl for increased flaviolin
  production. Similar, but much smaller, increases in titer by NaCl
  addition have been reported in other organisms and for diverse
  products. For example, NaCl has been shown to improve growth as
  well as isoprenol production in E. coli in the presence of ionic
  liquids56. Increased salinity (120 mM NaCl) also improved
  bioinsecticide production by Baccilus thurigiensis combined with
  heat-shock57. Squalene accumulation in the marine protist
  Thraustochytrium sp. peaked at a NaCl concentration of 85 mM58.
  Polyhydroxyalkanoate production was boosted in NaCl
  concentrations of up to 154 mM in Cuprividus necator59. Lastly, in
  activated sludge microbial communities, high NaCl was shown to
  increase protease activity and decrease glucosidase activity, while
  reducing the microbial diversity in the process60. However, most of
  these have been ad hoc observations rather than the product of a
  systematic study as we do here. When a systematic approach was

  ## Page 20

  followed, in the case of squalene production, NaCl and glucose were
  found as the most important drivers of production increase58.
  However, this was a marine protist, for which the relevance of NaCl
  is less surprising, and only three media components were tested.
  Even in this case, the optimal NaCl concentration was not nearly as
  extreme as the one found in this study (400–460 mM NaCl) for the
  putative biomanufacturing host P. putida. Indeed, these levels are
  comparable with those of seawater (600 mM), and higher than the
  concentration used in medium for marine microalgae (308 mM
  NaCl), prompting the consideration of production environments as
  very different from growth environments.
  In all three campaigns, K2HPO4 and FeSO4 were in the top five
  most influential components for high flaviolin production.
  Interestingly, FeSO4 showed negative impact for most of its highest
  concentrations in C1, which is the opposite trend to what we saw in
  C2 and C3 (Fig. 7, S8, S9). Similarly, K2HPO4 showed positive
  impact in the higher concentrations explored in C1, while in C2 the
  highest importance was observed in a “goldilocks region” within
  the explored concentrations, and in C3 it showed a much smaller
  importance. These apparent incongruencies likely resulted from the
  active learning algorithm exploring different parts of the phase
  space, changing the average explored concentration of each
  component, which is used to calculate a positive or negative effect
  (SHAP value) for each observation. In addition, given that the
  concentration of K2HPO4 was significantly smaller in the media
  providing the highest process yield, it seems likely that the
  phosphate demands in low glucose conditions are significantly
  diminished due to lower growth.
  Certain components were only significant in some campaigns. For
  example, K2SO4 was very important in C1, H3BO3 only in C2,
  NH4Cl in C1 and C2, and MgCl2 in C2 and C3. This variability is
  again due to the different trajectories the algorithm explored in the
  phase space. The remaining components showed minimal
  importance throughout all three campaigns, indicating that they are
  either unnecessary or required only in minimal concentrations,
  without adverse effects at higher levels.
  Conventional wisdom based on mass-action kinetics (i.e., the need

  ## Page 21

  to maximize the AcCoA pool) and previous transcriptomics analyses
  is at odds with the result of high flaviolin production under high
  salinity conditions. Previous transcriptomics have shown that high
  salinity concentrations significantly affect the central carbon
  metabolism in Pseudomonas species. In these transcriptomics studies
  the following was observed: flaggela-related proteins were downregulated, indicating a tendency to generate a biofilm in order to
  respond to osmotic stress; N-acetylglutamylglutamine amide
  (NAGGN) biosynthesis was upregulated, as this metabolite is one of
  the most prominent osmoprotectants; membrane composition was
  changed by overexpression of cardiolipin; and the expression of
  siderophores was upregulated as iron-carrying proteins are used to
  combat Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) stress (a common side-effect
  of osmotic stress)61. Similar results were found in P. aeruginosa,
  where NAGGN biosynthesis knockouts lost their ability to grow in
  NaCl concentrations of 500 mM, but this phenotype was rescued by
  adding betaine in the growth media62. However, cardiolipin
  requires glutamine and G3P to be synthesized, and NAGGN requires
  AcCoA and Glutamine. Glutamine consumption would pull carbon
  away from the production of flaviolin, which requires malonyl-CoA,
  and similar effects would be expected by pulling carbon from G3P
  and AcCoA. Hence, one would expect the production of flaviolin to
  decrease, rather than increase under high-salinity conditions,
  because carbon is being pulled away from the production of the
  precursors to flaviolin. This highlights how utilizing a purely datadriven approach can produce results and insights that are not
  obtainable through standard metabolic engineering approaches.
  ART outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches for
  guiding the optimization process
  Because the challengingly wide phase space targeted in this project
  demanded the most efficient algorithm, we used synthetic data to
  compare ART’s performance with two state-of-the-art alternatives:
  JMP63 and gpCAM64 (Fig. 8). JMP implements the RSM, which
  relies on a second degree polynomial, to design and augment
  experimental datasets, and it has been the default choice for process
  optimization through DoE. gpCAM implements gaussian processes
  to model the data and a global optimization algorithm to generate
  recommendations, and it has been used for automated

  ## Page 22

  experimentation in a synchrotron facility65. We also compared a
  new approach for generating ART recommendations: differential
  evolution, which is an evolutionary algorithm used for global
  optimization, and a part of the scipy.optimize suite66,67. We used
  synthetic data for this comparison because full experimental tests
  are expensive and time consuming, and these comparisons give a
  good estimate of the relative efficiency of methods. For each
  algorithm we simulated 10 DBTL cycles mimicking the
  experimental process used in this study: we started with 16
  instances with 15 input variables, and known response values. For
  each cycle, each of the algorithms was trained with the data
  collected so far and was used to provide 16 recommendations.
  These recommendations were used to generate responses using
  three functions of different difficulty to learn: an easy, a medium
  and a difficult one (Fig. 8), similarly to our previous work (Fig. 4 in
  Radivojevic et al.41). For each algorithm and difficulty level, the
  process was performed 10 times and averaged, so as to eliminate
  the effects of stochasticity.
  Fig. 8: ART outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms (JMP
  and gpCAM).
  [image]
  We used ART, JMP, gpCAM to guide three corresponding simulated
  active learning processes where the 15 input variables (media
  designs) and responses (flaviolin production) were used to
  recommend the next set of media designs. Response was simulated
  through three different functions that present different levels of
  difficulty to being “learnt”. These functions of increasing difficulty
  are: A \({F}_{Easy}=\,\frac{1}{d}{\sum }_{i}^{d}\, {({x}_{i}-5)}
  ^{2} \,+ \,{e}^{-{\sum }_{i}^{d}\;{x}_{i}^{2}}+25\), B \({F}
  _{Medium}=\frac{1}{d}{\sum }_{i}^{d}\;{x}_{i}^{4}-16{x}_{i}
  ^{2}+5{x}_{i}\) and C \({F}_{Diff}={\sum }_{i}^{d}\sqrt{{x}_{i}}
  sin({x}_{i})\) The starting media designs were the same for all
  algorithms and each process was run for 10 DBTL cycles. Each
  process was run ten different times, and the lines and shaded areas
  represent the mean and standard deviation of the highest
  production for each cycle. Individual traces for each run are shown
  in Fig. S10. Y* represents the maximum production at each cycle
  normalized by the true optimum of each function. We also tested a

  ## Page 23

  new recommendation algorithm for ART that improves on its
  original parallel tempering approach (ART_DE). ART and ART_DE
  reached the highest productions after 10 DBTL cycles, except in the
  case of FEasy, where the difference with the best algorithm (JMP) is
  minimal.
  Full size image
  ART performs overall better than both JMP and gpCAM when
  guiding an active learning process simulated through three
  functions of varying complexity (easy, medium, and difficult)
  (Fig. 8). For the easy function, JMP outperformed both ART and
  gpCAM, and is the only algorithm to predict the exact variable
  values for optimal production (with ART a very close second). This
  is probably due to the fact that the RSM used in JMP assumes
  quadratic interactions between terms, which is a very good
  approximation of the easy function. gpCAM performed the worst of
  the three algorithms for the easy function. In both the medium and
  difficult functions, ART outperformed both gpCAM and JMP. For
  the medium case, JMP struggled to even reach positive responses,
  and gpCAM improved response only linearly and very slowly. For
  the difficult case, JMP’s performance improved, but was not able to
  reach better responses than gpCAM or ART. As previously, in this
  case gpCAM only saw a very slow increase in response as more
  DBTL cycles accrued. Since JMP uses a quadratic approximation,
  when functions deviate from that form its performance is limited.
  On the other hand, gaussian processes are able to handle functions
  of arbitrary form, allowing for higher versatility and hence
  outperforming JMP in the medium and difficult cases. Lastly, ART
  uses an ensemble model, which includes a gaussian process among
  other algorithms. Since the ensemble performs as well or better
  than any of its constituting models, ART performs better than
  gpCAM. We also tested a new approach to select recommendations
  through ART that uses an evolutionary algorithm67, instead of
  parallel tempering41, to recommend the next set of media designs.
  The improved results from the evolutionary algorithm approach
  relative to parallel tempering warrant the inclusion of this method
  as part of the ART package from now on.
  In summary, ART required fewer data points for similar outcomes,

  ## Page 24

  or achieved better outcomes altogether, enabling the ambitious
  active learning approach taken here. These advantages are very
  important for applications in which data is expensive to acquire
  (such as synthetic biology). The availability of a very effective
  predictive algorithm enables the approach taken in this project, in
  which we explored a very large phase space with 12-13 variable
  components spanning 1-2 orders of magnitude each.
  Conclusion
  We have shown that active learning can optimize media in a
  systematic way that is agnostic to host, product, and pathway
  (Fig. 1), and can both generate surprising increases in production
  and identify unexpected key media components. To enable this
  active learning approach, high quality data are required, which we
  generated by creating a semi-automated pipeline (Fig. 2). This semiautomated pipeline enabled us to test up to 15 new media designs
  in triplicates within 3 days of experimentation (including a 48 h
  cultivation) with high repeatability within the same DBTL cycle
  (Fig. 3), between DBTL cycles (Fig. 4B) and between users and
  preparations (Fig. S3). Applying active learning to this pipeline
  produced 148% and 170% increases in titer and a 300% increase in
  process yield in three different campaigns (Fig. 4). When measured
  directly, without relying on the proxy used to guide the active
  learning process, titer increases were 70% and 60%, respectively,
  and the yield increase 350%. The active learning algorithm
  converged to similar regions of the phase space in all three
  campaigns even though the explored trajectories were different
  (Fig. 5), finding that media composition for maximal production
  differed significantly from the one traditionally used for assaying
  growth phenotypes. When we allowed the glucose concentration to
  change and optimized for process yield, we found that there is a
  tradeoff between titer and yield. This tradeoff was less prominent
  when using high NaCl concentrations (Fig. 6). Only five out of the
  twelve (or thirteen) media components strongly influenced
  production and, unexpectedly, NaCl was the most important
  (Fig. 7). The concentration of NaCl had been previously known to
  affect production levels in other cases, but not shown to be the most
  important driver, and optimal values were not nearly as extreme as

  ## Page 25

  the one found in this study. We also showed, using synthetic data,
  that ART outperforms a widely used DoE approach (JMP) and other
  machine learning approaches (gpCAM) when leading the active
  learning process using synthetic data. ART requires fewer data
  points for similar outcomes or achieving better outcomes altogether
  (Fig. 8). These advantages are critical in cases where the cost of and
  time for data acquisition is high, such as in synthetic biology. The
  novelty of this approach resides not so much in the amount of data
  being produced, but rather in how the data being produced is very
  efficiently leveraged by ART to guide an active learning process
  that effectively improves production by optimizing media, a
  problem that every bioengineer faces.
  The differences between Abs340 and analytical quantification
  through HPLC indicate that, contrary to what has been previously
  reported45, Abs340 is not a very accurate proxy for flaviolin,
  especially when the cells are grown in significantly different
  physiological conditions. However, the linear correlation between
  the Abs340 proxy and the HPLC (Fig. S2) shows that the use of
  Abs340 can help identify better media designs. While using HPLC
  for all measurements would have resulted in more accurate
  measurements, it would have also slowed down the experimental
  work and it is not clear that we would have been able to identify
  media compositions that enabled almost double flaviolin
  production. Hence, a proxy, even if imperfect, can be more
  desirable than a more exact measurement if it accelerates the active
  learning process and the ML algorithm can manage the noise.
  The ability to leverage fast DBTL cycles through automation
  allowed us to explore how active learning processes behave when
  several cycles are available. In our three campaigns, we have seen
  that the response does not improve in a monotonous fashion.
  Rather, improvements in the response happened in bursts and in a
  rather unpredictable fashion (Fig. S10): they may happen when we
  have collected many instances or a few, and when our predictive
  power is either high or low. This behavior is in agreement with
  other active learning studies published recently68,69. Hence, it is
  not trivial to decide when to finish a campaign. Due to the inherent
  stochasticity of this process, similar active learning processes (e.g.
  C1 and C2) will not follow the same trajectory in phase space, even

  ## Page 26

  if they end up converging on the same region. Experimental
  repeatability between biological replicates and DBTL cycles is
  critical for active learning to work properly: different responses for
  the same input can seriously diminish the predictive power of the
  algorithm and compromise the quality of the recommendations for
  the next cycle. When performed manually by a researcher, this
  active learning process is both time consuming and error prone: the
  preparation of 48 wells including 15 media designs with 12 variable
  components used here requires approximately 800 liquid transfers
  of varying volumes. Our carefully designed semi-automated pipeline
  (Fig. 2) provided the repeatability needed inside each cycle (Fig. 3),
  between cycles (Fig. 4B), and between users and preparations
  (Fig. S3). Moreover, it minimized hands-on time (approximately 1 
  hour for sample prep, 30 minutes for measuring OD600 and Abs340
  and 2 hours for data analysis). In the midst of the repeatability
  crisis70, such repeatability and reproducibility tests are crucial for
  biological research, especially in the context of machine learning.
  Furthermore, the low experimental noise provided by automation
  allowed for a smaller number of replicates, increasing the number
  of instances available for training and, eventually, increasing the
  predictive power. Finally, active learning can produce quite
  unexpected results if the phase space is made as wide as possible.
  However, a powerful predictive algorithm is required to efficiently
  search through this large phase space. In this case, the high
  predictive power and versatility of ART (Fig. 8), provided by the
  ensemble model design, and the quality of its recommendations,
  allowed us to explore a very large phase space with 12 (13 in
  campaign 3) variable components spanning 1-2 orders of magnitude
  each, even when starting from a very small training dataset (e.g. at
  DBTL3 of C1). This approach not only allowed us to optimize media
  while minimizing the number of (relatively expensive) experiments,
  but also to identify media designs that would not have been
  accessible using less powerful approaches, which might have
  required fully constraining some media components not expected to
  be important (e.g., NaCl). In this study, optical measurements
  (Abs340) correlated well with analytical measurements (HPLC),
  showing a coefficient of determination (R2) equal to 0.74 (Fig. S2).
  Even though this correlation is not perfect, performing optical
  measurements allowed us to perform fast DBTL cycles, enabling
  rapid improvements in titer and yield, which were confirmed

  ## Page 27

  through the HPLC measurements (the golden standard). More
  accurate measurements might enable higher or faster
  improvements. Solutions like the Agilent RapidFire-MS or (ultra)-
  high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) could bridge the
  gap between fast and accurate and fast measurements that enable
  machine learning in biology.
  The use of machine learning to optimize media generated
  interesting insights about P. putida metabolism. The optimal media
  for flaviolin production was very different from traditionally used
  growth media. Surprisingly, high salinity was consistently the most
  important factor increasing flaviolin production, with the optimal
  media designs containing concentrations of NaCl higher than 400 
  mM. The other two consistently important factors, K2HPO4 and
  FeSO4, were the iron and phosphate sources in the media. All these
  media components represent inexpensive additions to media that
  improve flaviolin production. The optimal salt concentration is
  comparable to seawater, opening up the possibility of considering
  brackish water for biomanufacturing using P. putida as a host,
  significantly decreasing the cost and environmental impact of
  biomanufacturing processes. Interestingly, we did not see a
  significant growth penalty with an increase in Abs340 (Fig. S11),
  showing that P. putida grows reasonably well in high NaCl
  concentrations. The study of flaviolin itself offers interesting clues
  to P. putida metabolism because it is a proxy for its precursor,
  malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA is central to metabolism and enables the
  biosynthesis of several industrially significant bioproducts, such as
  fatty acids. Indeed, the optimal salt concentration recommended by
  the machine learning approach runs counter to what traditional
  reasoning based on mass-action kinetics and available
  transcriptomics data would suggest to increase flux through
  malonyl-CoA to flaviolin. The main osmoprotectants generated
  require G3P, AcCoA, and glutamate and glutamine to pull carbon
  away from central metabolism, limiting the supply available for
  malonyl-CoA synthesis.
  This work provides an illustrative example of how machine learning
  can be used to accelerate and improve the biological engineering
  process. The traditional approach for media optimization would
  require producing a hypothesis from empirical biological knowledge

  ## Page 28

  or the literature (e.g., phosphate is an important part of biomass,
  which can impact production) and then performing experiments to
  test the hypothesis (e.g., measure production under five different
  levels of K2HPO4). The ML-guided approach used here is different:
  it aims to check the impact of media on production by generating a
  high-throughput pipeline that explores a wide phase space of all
  possible chemical concentrations (even for components that we do
  not expect will make a large difference). The generated data is then
  used to guide an active learning process that pinpoints which inputs
  are most important and, ultimately, the best media design. Both
  approaches use the scientific method of hypothesis generation and
  experimental testing, but the hypothesis used in the ML-guided
  approach is more general and wide, and ultimately produces better
  outcomes, and even unexpected results. The use of this approach for
  synthetic biology in general (e.g., pathway optimization or host
  engineering through gene interference) can significantly accelerate
  its timelines. This work also goes beyond previous applications of
  active learning to media optimization31 by showing that this
  approach can significantly improve production of valuable
  chemicals, that the most important production drivers can be
  inexpensive and unexpected components, that automation can
  significantly improve the active learning process, and that efficient
  recommender and prediction algorithms can make this active
  learning process run on a laptop instead of a supercomputer.
  Several possibilities for future work are suggested by this study.
  This media optimization process is fast and effective enough that it
  can be performed simultaneously with pathway or host
  optimization, leading to different optimal media for different
  production strains. Also, it would be desirable to use AI approaches
  to expand the phase space: i.e. suggest new components for the
  media to increase production, based on extant literature. In
  addition, due to the process being easy to learn, repeatable, and low
  cost, it can be either used as a teaching template for machine
  learning and automation, or as a testbed for self-driving labs (SDLs).
  In sum, this work illustrates how ML and automation can change
  the paradigm of current synthetic biology research to make it more
  effective and informative, and provides a cost-effective and
  underexploited strategy to facilitate the high TRYs essential for

  commercial success.
  Materials and Methods
  Chemicals, media, and culture conditions
  Standard inoculum cultures of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and
  Escherichia coli strains were conducted in LB medium at 30 °C and
  37 °C respectively with the addition of appropriate antibiotics.
  Antibiotics employed were carbenicillin (100 mg/L), kanamycin (50 
  mg/L), gentamicin (30 mg/L), and chloramphenicol (25 mg/L) all
  sourced in concentrated solution from Teknova. MOPS minimal
  media components: MOPS, tricine, FeSO4•7H2O, NH4Cl, K2SO4,
  MgCl2, NaCl, (NH4)6Mo7O24•4H2O, H3BO3, CoCl2, CuSO4, MnSO4,
  ZnSO4 were all sourced from Millipore Sigma. MOPS and tricine
  solutions were brought to pH 7.5 by the addition of 5 M or solid
  KOH. The flaviolin standard was prepared via preparative thin-layer
  chromatography (TLC) from P. putida KT2440 pBADT-rppA-NT
  extract as described previously38.
  Strain and plasmid construction
  Plasmids and primers were designed using the Device Editor and
  Vector Editor implementation of J571,72. PCR products were
  amplified using Q5 polymerase following the supplier’s instructions
  (NEB). All plasmids were constructed using NEB-HiFi reaction mix
  following the supplier’s instructions using either purified PCR
  product or 0.5 µL of each PCR reaction directly following DpnI
  digest (NEB). NEB-HiFi assembly mixtures were then transformed
  via heat shock into E. coli XL1-Blue chemical competent cells
  (Agilent). Plasmids were purified from E. coli via Qiaprep Spin
  Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced (Azenta Life Sciences). E. coli
  S17 was transformed via electroporation of purified plasmid DNA73.
  Construction of the PP_5404-5406::PhiC31attB strain (sART1) was
  conducted in the same manner as has been described previously for
  genetic knockouts in P. putida KT2440 except with the PhiC31attB
  site between the homology arms74. Briefly, P. putida KT2440 was

  ## Page 30

  conjugated with E. coli S17 carrying the knockout plasmid (pMQ30gentR-PP_5404-06::PhiC31attB). SacB/sucrose counterselection then
  was used to select for removal of the plasmid backbone and
  integrants were screened via PCR and the PCR products sequenced
  (Azenta Life Sciences). For integration of a constitutive rppA
  expression cassette, we constructed pColE1-ampR-Ptac-phiC31 (pIS1)
  and pColE1-kanR-PhiC31attP-PJ23100-rppA (pIS100). Plasmids
  pIS100 and pIS1 were mixed (100 ng each) and co-transformed via
  electroporation into sART1 yielding the constitutive flaviolin
  producing strain, sART275. Again, transformants were screened via
  PCR and PCR products sequenced (Azenta Life Sciences).
  All strains and plasmids are listed in Table 1 and are available
  through the JBEI public registry (https://public-registry.jbei.org/
  folders/874).

  The first step in using the active learning pipeline (Fig. 2, S1)
  involves deciding on the strain to be used, the media components
  and, importantly, the lower and upper bounds for each component.
  In this case, we selected a flaviolin-producing P. putida strain (see
  above) and the widely used, well-defined MOPS minimal media, in
  which we varied 12 components in C1 and C2 and 13 components
  in C3 (Table S1). In preparation for the media optimization
  processes, we used the media compiler library (https://github.com/
  JBEI/media_compiler) to calculate the stock concentrations to be
  mixed to build the media designs. This library takes into account
  the solubility and concentration bounds for each component, as

  ## Page 31

  well as physical limitations of the equipment (e.g. minimum
  transfer volume), and calculates two stock concentrations (a high
  and low concentration) for each component. Following this, based
  on each recommended media design, the pipeline outputs the
  required volume of each stock concentration for each component, as
  well as the required files to perform the transfers using the Biomek
  NX-S8.
  In the initial Design phase of the DBTL cycle, we generated 22
  initial media designs in C1 and 30 initial designs in C2 and C3
  generated using Latin Hypercube Sampling, and split these in 2
  DBTL cycles, DBTL 1 and DBTL 2 (Fig. 4, Fig. S5). The media
  designs, along with the stock concentrations, were used to calculate
  the required volume from each stock using the media compiler, and
  generate the liquid handler instructions. The Create_Transfers.ipynb
  notebook in the media compiler library creates the liquid handler
  instructions as follows: first, the amounts of each stock solution
  required for each media design are computed. Then, the source and
  destination wells are provided in a .csv file along with the volumes
  for each transfer. Different liquid handlers will require different
  formatting, the current output is designed for use in a BioMek
  NXS8. The controls in each DBTL cycle were based on the MOPS
  minimal media with random changes (up to ±10%, uniformly
  distributed) in the concentration of each of the variable components
  (12 for C1 and C2 and 13 for C3).
  In the Build step of the DBTL cycle, the stock plates were loaded
  onto the liquid handler (Biomek NX-S8) along with the culture
  inoculum and an empty Biolector 48-well flower plate, and 1.5 mL
  of media + inoculum was dispensed directly in the Biolector plate.
  The inoculum was prepared from an overnight culture, which was
  grown at 30 oC. Kanamycin (50 µg/mL) was used both for the
  overnight culture and the Biolector cultivation.
  In the Test step of the DBTL cycle, the strain cultivation took place
  in the Biolector Pro (Beckman) for 48 h at 30 oC, 800 rpm, and 80%
  relative humidity according to the manufacturer’s instruction for
  optimal oxygen transfer. Immediately post-cultivation, the liquid
  handler was used to prepare plates for absorbance measurements.
  For supernatant analysis, the liquid handler aliquoted 1 mL of

  ## Page 32

  culture into a 96 deep-well plate and spun at 3200 x g in a
  centrifuge (Eppendorf 5810 R). 200 μL of remaining culture and
  200 μL of culture supernatant from the deepwell plate were
  aliquoted into black-sided, clear-bottom 96 well plates. Abs340 and
  OD600 were measured as a proxy for flaviolin and cell density,
  respectively, using a Spectramax M2 microplate reader (Fig. 2). In
  campaign 3, the yield used as optimization target was the effective
  process yield (or process yield): i.e., the ratio of flaviolin divided by
  the initial glucose concentration. We used effective process yield
  because it is more amenable to high-throughput assays, and we
  believe it is most relevant to biomanufacturing purposes: it is the
  process yield that is typically used in technoeconomic analyses. The
  data, along with the media design information was then uploaded
  to the EDD43. In each cycle, we identified two types of outliers,
  likely stemming from errors by the liquid handler: 1) cases where
  one of three replicates did not produce any biomass or flaviolin,
  possibly due to an error when inoculating the well, and 2) cases
  where one triplicate had significantly higher Abs340 than the others,
  possibly due to transferring cells along with the supernatant. In
  both of these cases these media designs were removed from the
  pipeline and were not used to train ART. Creating the EDD study
  and data files is described in the notebooks
  “DBTLX_Create_EDD_Study_Files.ipynb”.
  In the Learn step of the DBTL cycle, the data from DBTL 1 and
  DBTL 2 were retrieved from the EDD and fed into ART to train its
  probabilistic model41. In the Design step for the next cycle, the
  phase space was sampled using parallel tempering41,76 (C1 and C2
  DBTL 3) or differential evolution66,67 (C2 DBLT4-6 and C3), to
  recommend media designs that maximize either flaviolin
  production (exploitation) or model uncertainty (exploration). The
  number of exploration and exploitation recommendations generated
  by ART in each DBTL cycle is shown in Table S2. The notebooks
  “DBTLX_C_ART_Media_Designs.ipynb” describes training ART and
  generating recommendations. Generating the instructions for the
  liquid handler is shown in the notebooks
  “DBTLX_D_Create_Transfers.ipynb”.
  In every DBTL cycle after DBTL 2, the model was trained on all the
  data generated from earlier DBTL cycles in its respective campaign

  ## Page 33

  (e.g. in DBTL 4 of C2, the model was trained using the data
  generated in DBTL 1 - DBTL 3 of C2). We then proceed to the Build
  step and iterate for the next DBTL cycles (5 DBTL cycles for C1 and
  C3 and 6 DBTL cycles for C2).
  HPLC method for flaviolin quantification
  Supernatants from 48-well flower-plate cultivation were diluted in
  an equal volume of methanol with 15 mg/L bisdemethoxycurcumin
  as an internal standard. Analysis was conducted on an HPLC
  (Agilent 1200 series) with a diode array detector (Agilent
  Technologies, USA). A Kinetex C-18 column was used for separating
  the analytes with no temperature control (approx. 20 °C) (2.6 μm
  diameter, 100 Å particle size, dimensions 100 × 3.00 mm,
  Phenomenex, USA). Water + 0.1% formic acid (A) and methanol +
  0.1% formic acid (B) were used as the mobile phase. 5 µL injection
  volume and a constant flow of 0.4 mL/min were used. The
  following gradient was used: 0-1 min 70% A, 1–10 min 70–30% A,
  10–20 min 30–17.5% A, 20–21 min 17.5–70% A, 21–26 min 70% A.
  Flaviolin was measured at 300 and 320 nm, and
  bisdemethoxycurcumin internal standard was measured at 440 nm.
  Flaviolin eluted at approximately 7.9 min, and
  bisdemethoxycurcumin eluted at approximately 13.7 min.
  Discrepancies in the increases in flaviolin concentration compared
  to the plate reader absorbance measurements are due to the linear
  fit of the comparison of these data sources having a nonzero y
  intercept (Fig. S2). This is likely the result of differences in the
  limits of detection between the two measurements. Indeed, the
  good but not too high correlation between Abs340 in our culture
  supernatant and HPLC measurements (R2 = 0.74), indicate that
  Abs340 is, at best, a semi-quantitative proxy for flaviolin. This is
  especially true when cells are grown in very diverse physiological
  conditions, since there is background Abs340, (Fig. S145)
  Feature importance to elucidate factors with large
  effects on bioproduction using Shapley analysis
  Feature importance was calculated using the SHAP python
  package55. SHAP uses the trained model to calculate the most
  important components of the media for flaviolin production. The

  ## Page 34

  model used for this analysis was trained on all 6 DBTL cycles,
  predicting flaviolin production based on the concentration of the
  media components. SHAP values were calculated based on the
  trained model and the training dataset. The Explainer class of the
  SHAP package was used as this was the most appropriate mode for
  an ensemble model. SHAP analysis is shown in the
  “DBTL1-5_Analysis.ipynb”/ “DBTL1-6_Analysis.ipynb” found in the
  repository of each campaign.
  Comparison with other algorithms
  For each algorithm, we performed 10 learning cycles, starting from
  16 observations with known function values, replicating the
  physical pipeline used in the rest of this work (Fig. 2). In each cycle
  we produced 16 new recommendations, used them as input in the
  benchmarking functions (Fig. 8), and used the responses obtained
  as the observations for the next cycle. To address the intrinsic
  stochasticity of the algorithms, we performed this process 10 times
  starting from the same initial observations, and calculated the mean
  and standard deviation of the highest suggested performance in
  each cycle.
  When benchmarking ART and gpCAM, we used an explorationexploitation tradeoff when generating recommendations. The
  objective function maximized to select the recommendations was:
  $${{\rm{G}}}({{\rm{x}}})=(1-\alpha ){{\rm{E}}}
  ({{\rm{y}}})+{{\rm{\alpha }}}{{\rm{Var}}}({{\rm{y}}})$$
  (1)
  Where x is the vector of input variables, y = y(x) is the response
  variable, and E(y) and Var(y) denote the expected value and
  variance of the probabilistic model output41. The explorationexploitation trade-off parameter α = 0.1*N, with N being the
  number of the DBTL cycle. Hence, in the first cycle, the objective
  function was
  $${{\rm{G}}}({{\rm{x}}})={{\rm{Var}}}({{\rm{y}}})$$
  (2)
  While in the 10th cycle the objective function was

  ## Page 35

  $${{\rm{G}}}({{\rm{x}}})={{\rm{E}}}({{\rm{y}}})$$
  (3)
  JMP does not support this tradeoff, and the maximum predicted
  production is reported for each cycle.
  ART is based on an ensemble method, which combines multiple
  models, out of which 2 of them were TPOT models77. gpCAM was
  trained using the default gaussian kernel and JMP was trained using
  the Response Surface Methodology, which is a quadratic
  approximation of the response surface. gpCAM training is shown in
  the notebook “gpcam_benchmark_funcs.ipynb”, and ART using
  parallel tempering training was performed using the
  “ART_benchmark_runs.py”. Differential evolution training is shown
  in the notebook “ART_DE_benchmark_runs.ipynb” included in the
  repository for C1.

  Abstract
  Artificial dye-coupled assays have been widely adopted as a rapid
  and convenient method to assess the activity of methanol
  dehydrogenases (MDH). Lanthanide(Ln)-dependent XoxF-MDHs are
  able to incorporate different lanthanides (Lns) in their active site.
  Dye-coupled assays showed that the earlier Lns exhibit a higher
  enzyme activity than the late Lns. Despite widespread use, there are
  limitations: oftentimes a pH of 9 and activators are required for the
  assay. Moreover, Ln-MDH variants are not obtained by isolation
  from the cells grown with the respective Ln, but by incubation of an
  apo-MDH with the Ln. Herein, we report the cultivation of Lndependent methanotroph Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV
  with nine different Lns, the isolation of the respective MDHs and
  the assessment of the enzyme activity using the dye-coupled assay.
  We compare these results with a protein-coupled assay using its
  physiological electron acceptor cytochrome cGJ (cyt cGJ ).
  Depending on the assay, two distinct trends are observed among the
  Ln series. The specific enzyme activity of La-, Ce- and Pr-MDH, as
  measured by the protein-coupled assay, exceeds that measured by
  the dye-coupled assay. This suggests that early Lns also have a
  positive effect on the interaction between XoxF-MDH and its cyt cGJ
  thereby increasing functional efficiency.
  Keywords: lanthanide-dependent bacteria; lanthanides;
  metalloenzymes; methanol dehydrogenase; methylotrophy.

  ABSTRACT

  ## Page 2

  This survey paper provides an in-depth analysis of various machine
  learning techniques and algorithms that are utilized in the detection
  of PPI (Protein-Protein Interactions). For every technique examined,
  the paper evaluates its efficiency, shortcomings, possibilities for
  enhancement, and outlook for the future. A major challenge in
  current survey papers focusing on machine learning algorithms for
  PPI identification is the successful categorization of these
  algorithms. To overcome this challenge, the paper introduces a
  novel hierarchical taxonomy that organizes algorithms into more
  intricate categories and distinct techniques. The proposed taxonomy
  is constructed on a four-tier structure, beginning with the broad
  methodology category, and ending with specific sub-techniques.
  This structure facilitates a more systematic and exhaustive
  categorization of algorithms, aiding researchers in grasping the
  connections between different algorithms and techniques. Included
  in the paper are both empirical and experimental assessments to
  classify the various techniques. The empirical assessment judges the
  techniques according to four standards. The experimental
  evaluations carry out the following rankings: (1) the algorithms that
  employ the same specific sub-technique, (2) the different subtechniques that employ the same technique, (3) the different
  techniques that employ the same methodology sub-category, and
  (4) the different methodology sub-categories within the same
  methodology category. By merging the new methodological
  taxonomy, empirical analyses, and experimental evaluations, the
  paper provides a multifaceted and thorough comprehension of the
  machine learning methods and algorithms for PPI detection. This
  synthesis helps researchers make well-informed decisions. In its
  conclusion, the paper furnishes crucial insights into the future
  possibilities of machine learning techniques for PPI identification,
  underscoring potential advancements and areas ripe for continued
  exploration and development.

  Abstract
  There is emerging interest in the role of lanthanides as cofactors for
  XoxF-type methanol dehydrogenase (MDH). Here, classical
  molecular dynamics simulations combined with fragment molecular
  orbital calculations were employed to rationalize the enzymatic
  activities of MDH (both XoxF- and MxaF-types) carrying different
  lanthanides. In XoxF-type MDH, lanthanide binding to cofactor
  pyrroloquinoline quinone was found to switch from tridentate to
  unidentate fashion as it switches from lighter to heavier
  lanthanides. This fact possibly plays a crucial role in the enzymatic
  activity exclusive to XoxF-type MDH incorporating lighter
  lanthanides.

  Motile bacteria take a competitive advantage in colonization of plant surfaces 
  to establish beneficial associations that eventually support plant health. Plant 
  exudates serve not only as primary growth substrates for bacteria but also as 
  bacterial chemotaxis attractants. A number of plant-derived compounds and 
  corresponding chemotaxis sensors have been documented, however, the 
  sensors for methanol, one of the major volatile compounds released by plants, 
  have not been identified. Methylobacterium species are ubiquitous plant surfacesymbiotic, methylotrophic bacteria. A plant-growth promoting bacterium, M. 
  aquaticum strain 22A exhibits chemotaxis toward methanol (methylotaxis). Its 
  genome encodes 52 methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), among 
  which we identified three MCPs (methylotaxis proteins, MtpA, MtpB, and MtpC) 
  responsible for methylotaxis. The triple gene mutant of the MCPs exhibited no 
  methylotaxis, slower gathering to plant tissues, and less efficient colonization 
  on plants than the wild type, suggesting that the methylotaxis mediates initiation 
  of plant-Methylobacterium symbiosis and engages in proliferation on plants. To 
  examine how these MCPs are operating methylotaxis, we  generated multiple 
  gene knockouts of the MCPs, and Ca2+-dependent MxaFI and lanthanide (Ln3+)-
  dependent XoxF methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs), whose expression is regulated 
  by the presence of Ln3+. MtpA was found to be a cytosolic sensor that conducts 
  formaldehyde taxis (formtaxis), as well as methylotaxis when MDHs generate 
  formaldehyde. MtpB contained a dCache domain and exhibited differential 
  cellular localization in response to La3+. MtpB expression was induced by La3+, and 
  its activity required XoxF1. MtpC exhibited typical cell pole localization, required 
  MxaFI activity, and was regulated under MxbDM that is also required for MxaF 
  expression. Strain 22A methylotaxis is realized by three independent MCPs, two 
  of which monitor methanol oxidation by Ln3+-regulated MDHs, and one of which 
  monitors the common methanol oxidation product, formaldehyde. We propose 
  that methanol metabolism-linked chemotaxis is the key factor for the efficient 
  colonization of Methylobacterium on plants.

  Introduction
  Microbial plant colonizers recognize the existence of plants by 
  sensing the chemicals released by plants to establish their symbiotic 
  or pathogenic relationships (Scharf et al., 2016). Most motile bacteria 
  have an array of sensors called methyl-accepting chemotaxis receptors 
  (MCPs). MCPs and the cooperating Che system that transmits the 
  signals from MCPs to the flagellar motor regulate the direction of 
  flagellar rotation and enable attractant-directed swimming, defined as 
  chemotaxis (Karmakar, 2021). The chemotaxis mechanism has been 
  extensively studied using Escherichia coli as a model organism. The 
  E. coli genome encodes five MCP genes, whose detailed function and 
  their ligands have been studied well (Sourjik and Armitage, 2010). In 
  contrast, plant-colonizing bacteria possess huge numbers of MCPs. 
  For example, Rhizobium species have 15 to 30 MCPs, Agrobacterium 
  species have 20 to 40 MCPs, and Bradyrhizobium species have 30 to 
  60 MCPs (Scharf et al., 2016). These receptors typically contain an 
  N-terminal ligand-binding region and a C-terminal signaling region 
  containing a methyl-accepting domain. The ligand-binding domains 
  of the large majority (~88%) of bacterial MCPs have not been 
  annotated (Lacal et al., 2010).
  Methylobacterium species are ubiquitous methylotrophic 
  colonizers on plant aerial surfaces (phyllosphere), and they can occupy 
  10 to 20% of total culturable bacteria on plant surfaces (Vorholt, 
  2012). Methanol released by plants as a byproduct of pectin 
  degradation (Fall and Benson, 1996) offers a niche for methylotrophic 
  bacteria. Plant-associated methylotrophic bacteria are also capable of 
  synthesizing phytohormones that can affect plant growth, resulting in 
  plant growth promotion (Dourado et  al., 2015). Thus, 
  Methylobacterium species are recognized as mutual symbionts 
  for plants.
  Methylobacterium species oxidize methanol mainly using two 
  different methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs), MxaFI and XoxF. The 
  former is a calcium (Ca2+)-dependent enzyme, whereas the latter was 
  found to be a lanthanide (Ln3+)-dependent enzyme (Anderson et al., 
  1990; Hibi et al., 2011; Nakagawa et al., 2012; Keltjens et al., 2014). 
  Another Ln3+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase, ExaF, was found in 
  Methylorubrum extorquens strain AM1 (Good et  al., 2016) and 
  Methylobacterium aquaticum strain 22A (Yanpirat et  al., 2020). 
  Recognition and transport of Ln3+, Ln3+-dependent regulation of 
  methylotrophy genes, and catalytic and regulatory activity of XoxF are 
  currently emerging fields of study on methylotrophic bacteria 
  (Skovran et al., 2011; Vu et al., 2016; Ochsner et al., 2019; RoszczenkoJasińska et al., 2020). Though Lns are included in “rare earth metals,” 
  the concentration of Ln3+ in soils is not low and is almost equivalent 
  to those of copper, cobalt, and zinc (Kamenopoulos et al., 2016). XoxF 
  is more widespread in methylotrophic bacteria than MxaF and is 
  believed to be closer to an ancient form of MDHs (Chistoserdova, 
  2019; Skovran et al., 2019). Thus, Ln3+ has a pivotal regulatory role in 
  the methylotrophy and physiology of methylotrophic bacteria (Tani 
  et al., 2021).
  Methylobacterium aquaticum strain 22A is an isolate from a 
  hydroponic culture of a moss, Racomitrium japonicum, and is also a 
  potent plant growth promoter (Tani et al., 2012). The strain has the 
  MDHs described above (MxaFI and XoxF1) as well as ExaF (Tani 
  et al., 2015; Masuda et al., 2018; Yanpirat et al., 2020). XoxF1 and ExaF 
  are induced by Ln3+, whereas MxaF is induced in the absence of Ln3+. 
  For formaldehyde oxidation, the strain employs two different 
  pathways, the H4MPT pathway and the GSH pathway (Yanpirat 
  et al., 2020).
  The 22A genome encodes as many as 52 MCPs. As reported 
  previously, we found that some bacteria including Methylobacterium 
  species exhibit chemotaxis toward methanol (Tola et al., 2019). In this 
  study, we revealed that strain 22A has three MCPs each responsible 
  for chemotaxis towards methanol and its metabolite formaldehyde 
  (here we  define methylotaxis and formtaxis, respectively), the 
  methylotaxis is realized by the coordination of MCPs with the 
  methanol metabolism that is regulated by Ln3+, and the methylotaxis 
  has a critical role in locating plants.
  Results
  Identification of three MCPs involved in 
  methylotaxis
  A microscopy-aided capillary-plug assay was employed to assess 
  chemotaxis activity. Strain 22A methylotaxis was inducible by 
  methanol (Supplementary Figure S1). Strain 22A cells were incubated 
  in HEPES buffer (20 mM, pH 7.0) at 20°C for 2 h after overnight 
  cultivation on methanol (as optimized in Supplementary 
  Figures S1B,C). Strain 22A exhibited taxis toward DL-malate, 
  DL-glycerate, and L-glutamate (Supplementary Figure S1D). The 
  amino acid sequences of 52 MCP genes encoded in the strain 22A 
  genome conserve a common MCP signal domain at their C-terminus 
  in most cases, and other different domains, such as dCache, 4HB_
  MCP_1, and HAMP domains (Supplementary Figure S2). 
  We generated single-gene knockout mutants for 15 genes that are 
  induced by methanol in the transcriptome data of strain 22A (Masuda 
  et al., 2018), but none of the mutants lost methylotaxis completely 
  (Supplementary Figure S3). Because mtpA knockout strain (maq22A_
  c14925, ΔmtpA) exhibited significantly weaker methylotaxis than the 
  wild type, we hypothesized that strain 22A has multiple methylotaxis 
  MCPs. Then, we generated multi-gene knockouts based on ΔmtpA 
  mutant. The additional knockouts of mtpB (maq22A_1p32440) and 
  mtpC (maq22A_c15300) that also showed weaker methylotaxis in the 
  screening, resulted in a complete loss of methylotaxis. Hereafter 
  we call ΔmtpAΔmtpBΔmtpC mutant the TM (triple gene mutant).
  The TM grown on methanol in the presence and absence of LaCl3 
  did not exhibit any methylotaxis (Figure 1A) but retained chemotaxis 
  toward yeast extract (2%) used as a mixture of amino acids. These 
  results suggested that the mutant is not impaired in its chemotaxis 
  machinery but only in attractant recognition and that the taxis 
  response of La3+ is specific to methanol.
  In MtpA amino acid sequence we detected only an MCP signaling 
  domain (Figure 1B) involved in its dimerization and interaction with 
  CheA protein and the adaptor protein CheW. The absence of the 
  transmembrane region suggested that MtpA operates in the 
  cytoplasm. MtpB contains a putative signal peptide, dCache_1 
  domain, a transmembrane domain, and a HAMP domain. The 
  dCache_1 is the predominant sensor domain that recognizes wide 
  variety of compounds including proteinogenic amino acids, 
  polyamines, quaternary amines, purines, organic acids, sugars, 
  quorum sensing signals, or inorganic ions (Matilla et al., 2021). The 
  HAMP domain transmits the outside signal into the cytosol 
  (Parkinson, 2010). MtpC contains a signal peptide, a transmembrane

  region, and a HAMP domain, exhibiting a typical structure of general 
  MCPs. The predicted periplasmic domain has no sign for any known 
  domains. Thus, we concluded that MtpA has atypical topology IV 
  (cytosolic receptor), and MtpB and MtpC have typical topology I with 
  an extracellular ligand binding domain, according to the classification 
  by Lacal et al. (2010).
  The single-gene knockouts of three MCPs exhibited different 
  intensities of methylotaxis (Figure 1C). Deletion of mtpA resulted in 
  a significant decrease in methylotaxis activity, suggesting its major 
  contribution to cellular methylotaxis. Whereas methylotaxis of 
  ∆mtpA and ∆mtpC mutants was not affected by the presence of LaCl3, 
  ΔmtpB mutant exhibited weaker methylotaxis when it is grown on 
  methanol in the presence of LaCl3 (hereafter called the MeOH+La 
  condition) than when it is grown on methanol in the absence of LaCl3 
  (MeOH-La condition), suggesting that MtpB contributes to 
  methylotaxis more in the presence of La3+. Indeed, mtpB expression is 
  approximately twofold increased by La3+ (Supplementary Figure S3).
  Then we examined the sensitivity and Ln-dependency of the 
  methylotaxis of the double gene knockouts (Figure 1D), and found 
  that MtpA is a relatively sensitive sensor, MtpB is a relatively lesssensitive sensor operating in the presence of La3+, and MtpC is a 
  relatively less-sensitive sensor operating in the absence of La3+. These

  data indicated that each MCP with different sensitivity operates 
  independently, and their expression and activity depend on the 
  availability of La3+.
  The methylotaxis MCPs were expressed as green fluorescent 
  protein (GFP)(C-terminal)-fusion proteins under the control of their 
  promoters in strain 22A wild type, and their cellular localization was 
  examined with confocal microscopy (Figure 1E). The promoter-less 
  vector control did not exhibit any fluorescence. MtpA-GFP 
  localization was observed in the cytoplasm, as predicted above. The 
  MtpB-GFP signal was observed at the pole of the cells grown in the 
  MeOH-La condition, whereas interestingly, it was observed at the cell 
  periphery in the MeOH+La condition. The MtpC-GFP signal was 
  observed at the cell pole. It is known that essentially all of the MCP 
  molecules cluster together with CheA and CheW to form the 
  chemotaxis sensory array at the cell pole (Briegel et al., 2009).
  The methylotaxis MCP genes with their promoter region were 
  PCR-amplified and cloned into pAT01 (Fujitani et  al., 2022) to 
  generate pAT01-MtpA, -MtpB, and-MtpC. The methylotaxis of TM 
  transformed with these plasmids was examined (Supplementary 
  Figure S4). The TM carrying pAT01-MtpA showed comparable 
  methylotaxis activity irrespective to the presence of LaCl3. The TM 
  carrying pAT01-MtpB and-MtpC showed higher methylotaxis when 
  grown in the presence and absence of LaCl3, respectively. These 
  responses to La3+ were in line with the result obtained in 
  Figure 1D. These gene complementation experiments indicated that 
  the phenotype of the mutants was caused by the MCP gene deletion 
  and not by polar effect.
  The TM exhibited no growth defect on methanol, irrespective of 
  the presence of La3+ (Supplementary Figure S5), suggesting that the 
  methylotaxis MCPs are not involved in methanol metabolism and 
  its regulation.
  Methylotaxis engages in locating plants 
  and phyllospheric growth
  To examine whether methylotaxis is involved in locating plants, 
  first, we quantified the methanol exuded by rice roots in hydroponic 
  culture (Supplementary Figure S6). After 8 h of seedling 
  transplantation, the methanol concentration in the medium reached 
  a maximum (3.5 mM = 0.01% w/v) and then gradually decreased. The 
  methanol exudation rate was calculated to be  approximately 
  0.113 mmol (=3.6 mg)/g plant fresh weight/h.
  The taxis toward Arabidopsis and rice roots was examined by 
  counting the number of cells gathered and attached to the roots after 
  soaking the roots in the cell suspensions (Figure 2A). The wild-type 
  cells gathered to plant roots rapidly, but the TM exhibited less efficient 
  gathering in the tested duration. These results suggested that the 
  methanol and methylotaxis of strain 22A engage in locating the plants. 
  The strain 22A wild-type cells gather at specific sites at the edge of 
  Arabidopsis leaves, where they swim around actively (Figure 2B). 
  These sites should be stomata or hydathodes, which are most possibly 
  the sites releasing methanol.
  To reveal the physiological role of methylotaxis in the 
  phyllosphere, the ability of seed-inoculated strain 22A and TM to 
  colonize plant leaves was compared. The cells were labeled with the 
  fluorescent protein mVenus and inoculated on sterilized red perilla 
  seeds that were cultivated aseptically. During cultivation, the cells 
  washed off from the leaves were quantified by flow cytometry. 
  Whereas the cell number of TM remained low during the course of 
  experiment, at certain time points (e.g., at 55 and 96 days) the number 
  of wild-type cells was significantly higher than that of TM cells 
  (Figure 2C). These large fluctuations might be due to plasmid loss in 
  the non-selective experimental setup and also to ununiform 
  colonization pattern of the cells on individual plants and leaves. Leafimprinting also indicated that the wild type 22A colonized red perilla 
  leaves more widely and densely than the TM (Figure 2D). These 
  results suggested that methylotaxis contributes to efficient colonization 
  in the phyllosphere.
  Formtaxis as a metabolism-linked 
  methylotaxis
  Methylobacterium species oxidize methanol rapidly with MDHs, 
  and the product formaldehyde is taken into the cytosol for further 
  oxidation and assimilation. However, it is also released extracellularly 
  (Masuda et al., 2018) from the periplasm where the oxidation by 
  MDHs occurs. If strain 22A is chemotactic to formaldehyde, the 
  methylotaxis observed above may include formtaxis. Strain 22A 
  exhibited formtaxis irrespective of La3+ and the TM did not exhibit any 
  formtaxis (Figure  3A). This result suggested that any of the 
  methylotaxis MCP(s) is also involved in formtaxis, and no MCPs 
  other than these three MCPs encoded in the genome are involved in 
  formtaxis, as long as the strain is grown in the used conditions.
  Next, we examined the formtaxis in double-gene knockouts of 
  methylotaxis MCPs with varied concentrations of formaldehyde 
  (Figure 3B). The wild type exhibited stronger formtaxis when grown 
  in the MeOH-La condition than in the MeOH+La condition, and the 
  best concentration of formaldehyde was 0.2%. ΔmtpBΔmtpC mutant 
  exhibited strong formtaxis compared to the wild type, for the high 
  concentration of formaldehyde (2%) only when it was grown in the 
  MeOH-La condition. ΔmtpAΔmtpC mutant exhibited moderate 
  formtaxis when grown in the MeOH-La condition, for 0.2% 
  formaldehyde. ΔmtpAΔmtpB mutant exhibited almost no formtaxis 
  at any tested concentrations of formaldehyde. Thus, MtpC is involved 
  only in methylotaxis and not in formtaxis.
  Strain 22A did not exhibit any taxis toward 2 and 0.2% formate 
  that is also a metabolite in methylotrophic pathway (data not shown), 
  although formate serves as a chemoattractant for a soil plant pathogen, 
  Agrobacterium fabrum strain C58 (Wang et al., 2021).
  The strain 22A genome encodes genes for the H4MPT pathway 
  that plays a central role in formaldehyde oxidation, starting with the 
  reaction catalyzed by the formaldehyde-activating enzyme (Fae). 
  Strain 22A has two homologous fae genes (fae1 and fae2). Strain 22A 
  (and many other Methylobacterium strains in the C1 clade, Alessa 
  et al., 2021) have additional glutathione-dependent formaldehyde 
  oxidation pathway (GSH pathway) genes composed of gfa 
  (glutathione-dependent formaldehyde-activating enzyme), hgd 
  (S-hydroxymethyl 
  glutathione 
  dehydrogenase), 
  and 
  fgh 
  (S-formylglutathione hydrolase). The Δfae1Δfae2Δhgd mutant is 
  completely defective in formaldehyde metabolism and unable to grow 
  even on succinate in the presence of methanol, due to formaldehyde 
  toxicity (Yanpirat et al., 2020). The mutant grown in the absence of 
  methanol did not lose methylotaxis and formtaxis (Figure  3C), 
  suggesting that methylotaxis and formtaxis do not require the

  formaldehyde metabolic pathways. Whereas the chemotactic cells 
  usually gather and swim around the capillary mouth in the assay, the 
  mutant cells could no longer swim once gathered around the capillary, 
  suggesting that they were toxified by formaldehyde (data not shown). 
  The Δfae1Δfae2Δhgd mutant exhibited stronger formtaxis than the 
  wild type in the presence of La3+, the possible reason for which is 
  discussed below.
  Examination of the relationships between 
  MDHs and MCPs revealed that MtpA is 
  responsible for formtaxis
  To examine the involvement of MDHs in methylotaxis and 
  formtaxis, we tested MDH gene knockouts of strain 22A grown on 
  succinate plus methanol. XoxF1 is necessary for the expression of 
  MxaF, therefore, ΔxoxF1 mutant cannot grow on methanol, 
  irrespective of La3+. ΔmxaF mutant can grow on methanol only in the 
  presence of La3+ due to intact XoxF1. ΔxoxF1Sup mutant is a 
  suppression mutant derived from ΔxoxF1 mutant that carries a 
  mutation in mxbD encoding a sensor kinase responsible for mxaF 
  expression, and the mutant restored the mxaF-dependent growth on 
  methanol without xoxF1 (Yanpirat et al., 2020).
  ΔxoxF1 and ΔxoxF1ΔmxaF mutants did not exhibit any 
  methylotaxis but retained formtaxis (Figure 4). ∆mxaF mutant grown 
  in the presence of La3+ and ∆xoxF1Sup retained methylotaxis. Thus, 
  either of the active MDHs is necessary for methylotaxis, and formtaxis 
  does not necessitate active MDHs. Namely, there may be MCP(s) that 
  recognize(s) formaldehyde.
  To differentiate which of methanol and formaldehyde is 
  recognized by each MCP, we generated double methylotaxis MCP 
  gene knockouts in the background of a series of MDH gene 
  knockouts (Figure 4). All mutants were motile under microscopic 
  observation, and TM under ∆mxaF∆xoxF1 background exhibited 
  wild-type level of taxis toward yeast extract (data not shown), 
  supporting the idea that the defect in methylotaxis was not due to the 
  loss of swimming motility.
  The ΔmtpBΔmtpC knockout mutants under ΔxoxF1 and 
  ΔmxaFΔxoxF1 backgrounds retained formtaxis irrespective of 
  La3+, 
  whereas 
  they 
  lost 
  methylotaxis, 
  suggesting 
  that

  MtpA-dependent methylotaxis depends on formaldehyde 
  generation by MDHs, and MtpA-dependent formtaxis does not 
  require MDHs. Therefore, MtpA is responsible for formtaxis. The 
  relatively high formtaxis in ΔmtpBΔmtpC mutant under 
  ΔmxaFΔxoxF1 background in the presence of La3+ might be due 
  to formaldehyde generation by ExaF that is active for methanol as 
  well as ethanol. Interestingly, the ΔmtpBΔmtpC mutant under 
  ΔxoxF1Sup background exhibited high methylotaxis and 
  formtaxis. ΔxoxF1Sup mutant constitutively and highly expresses 
  mxaF. Therefore, formaldehyde generated by MxaF might 
  promote the taxis.
  The vector for the MtpA-GFP construct was introduced into the 
  TM, 
  and 
  the 
  transformant 
  exhibited 
  formtaxis 
  (Supplementary Figure S7), suggesting that the cytosol-localized 
  GFP-tagged MtpA (Figure 1E) is functional.
  MtpB depends on MDH activity and La3+
  The ΔmtpAΔmtpC mutants under any MDH knockouts lost 
  methylotaxis and formtaxis in the absence of La3+ (Figure 4), partly 
  because the expression of mtpB is low in the absence of 
  La3+(Supplementary Figure S3). In the presence of La3+, the 
  ΔmtpAΔmtpC mutant under ΔmxaF and ΔxoxF1Sup backgrounds 
  retained low but significant levels of taxis, because either of the MDHs 
  is operating in these mutants.
  The strong formtaxis exhibited in Δfae1Δfae2Δhgd mutant in the 
  presence of La3+ (Figure  3C) might be  due to the formaldehyde 
  accumulation caused by the mutation and the participation of the 
  MtpB activity sensing XoxF1-dependent formaldehyde oxidation.
  Strain 22A grown on methanol also exhibited ethanol-taxis, and 
  the assay with double MCP gene knockouts suggested that MtpB 
  contributes most to the ethanol-taxis (Supplementary Figure S8A). 
  TM exhibited weak activity in the absence of La3+, suggesting that 
  strain 22A has other unidentified MCPs for ethanol-taxis that operate, 
  especially in the absence of La3+. The methylotaxis activity was 
  competitively lost in the presence of high concentrations of ethanol 
  (Supplementary Figure S8B).
  MtpC activity necessitates MxaF and is 
  under the regulation of MxbDM
  The ΔmtpAΔmtpB mutants exhibited almost no methylotaxis or 
  formtaxis under backgrounds of ΔmxaF, ΔxoxF1, and ΔmxaFΔxoxF1, 
  but exhibited strong taxis for both attractants under a ΔxoxF1Sup 
  background (Figure 4), suggesting that the activity or expression of 
  MtpC depends on MxaF. To examine whether the expression of MtpC 
  depends on the expression of mxaF, we  measured the promoter 
  activity of mtpC (PmtpC) in various MDH knockouts using a promoterreporter (luciferase) vector (Figure 5). The PmtpC activity was notably 
  higher in ΔxoxF1Sup mutant, and negligible in ΔxoxF1 and 
  ΔmxaFΔxoxF1 mutants. The PmtpC activity was not lost in ΔmxaF 
  mutant, suggesting that the expression of mtpC is not dependent on 
  the presence of mxaF. Therefore, we conclude that MtpC is dependent 
  on MxaF activity but not on its expression. Namely, the ligand for 
  MtpC is not methanol.
  mxaF expression is dependent on the presence of xoxF1 and a 
  two-component signaling system, MxbDM. The PmtpC activity was 
  abolished almost completely in the ∆mxbD mutant, suggesting that 
  mtpC expression is under regulation by mxbDM, which also 
  regulates mxaF.

  Discussion
  Chemotaxis is one of the bacterial survival strategies that enable 
  the cells to reach nutrients, and also to establish symbiotic and 
  associative relationships between hosts and microorganisms (AllardMassicotte et al., 2016; Scharf et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2019). Previously, 
  we showed that environmental bacteria including Methylobacterium 
  species exhibited methylotaxis (Tola et  al., 2019). However, its 
  molecular mechanism and contribution to bacterial survival have 
  remained elusive. In this study, we proved that a methylotrophic 
  plant–growth promoting bacterium M. aquaticum strain 22A has as 
  many as three MCPs for methylotaxis (Figure 1).
  Strain 22A utilizes methylotaxis to locate the plant and to initiate 
  symbiosis, and gathers in specific niches of natural openings, such as 
  stomata and hydathodes (Figures 2A,B). The seed-inoculated TM 
  exhibited less efficient colonization on perilla leaves than the wild type 
  (Figures 2C,D). It is currently unknown whether this is a result of the 
  fewer opportunities to reach favorable niches that eventually support 
  bacterial cell proliferation or the cellular spontaneous migration from 
  seeds to leaves on the plant surface or through internal tissues of the 
  vascular system (Chi et al., 2005; Ji et al., 2010). Methylotaxis is one of 
  the survival strategies that enable Methylobacterium cells to reach 
  nutrients and to establish symbiosis with plants.
  Although three MCPs are involved in the same cellular function 
  of methylotaxis, they operate independently and have distinctly 
  different characteristics in their secondary structures, induction 
  response to La3+, sensitivity, and cellular localization. To add an 
  evolutionary viewpoint to their function and conservation, 
  we examined MCP genes in the genomes of 62 type strains of the 
  genera (1,467 MCP genes in total, 23.3 genes per genome, 
  Supplementary Table S1). The type strains of clade A and C with 
  relatively larger genomic sizes contain relatively larger numbers of 
  MCP genes (average: 34 genes). We  also tested the methylotaxis 
  activity of the type strains grown in the MeOH+La condition that 
  supports the growth of all type strains. Twenty-six strains among the 
  tested 60 type strains exhibited swimming motility, and all of them 
  exhibited methylotaxis with different intensities. The methylotaxis 
  MCP genes found in this study were not necessarily conserved in 
  these strains, suggesting that another type of methylotaxis MCP exists.
  MtpA was found to function in the cytosol (Figure  1E; 
  Supplementary Figure S7) and is primarily responsible for formtaxis 
  (Figure 3B), but also engages in methylotaxis when MDH is functional 
  (Figure 4). MtpA is considered to be a sensor for methylotaxis that 
  navigates the cells to the place where more formaldehyde is produced. 
  Although formaldehyde can also be detected in plants (Blunden et al., 
  1998), considering the difference in sensitivity of methylotaxis and 
  formtaxis (Figures 1D, 3B), abundant methanol emission from plants 
  (Supplementary Figure S6), and ubiquity of functional MDHs in 
  Methylobacterium species, methylotaxis would first be prioritized to 
  locate plants in nature. It is reported that E. coli cells are supposed to 
  secrete serine upon being attracted by aspartic acid, and serine is used 
  as a signaling molecule to attract other cells (Long et al., 2017). The 
  formaldehyde secreted by the methanol-oxidizing cells may serve as a 
  secondary signal to gather other Methylobacterium cells and to 
  enhance the colonization of the species. Although MtpA is conserved 
  in clade C members (Supplementary Table S1) in which the GSH 
  pathway is also conserved (Alessa et al., 2021), the formtaxis did not 
  necessitate the formaldehyde metabolism pathways. Thus, it is unlikely 
  that a metabolic intermediate (such as S-formylglutathione, H4MPT, 
  etc.) in the pathways is the ligand for MtpA. The clade C members are 
  considered to be  evolutionary ancestors that may prefer soil, 
  rhizosphere, or aquatic environments to the phyllosphere (Leducq 
  et al., 2022). It is interesting to hypothesize that MtpA-dependent 
  formtaxis may contribute to colonizing a niche by convening 
  colleagues in such environments. There is no hint for ligand based on 
  MtpA structural information. It is reported that about one-quarter of

  bacteria cytoplasmic chemoreceptors had no identifiable domain, 
  whereas about half of analyzed chemoreceptors contain PAS domain 
  that is involved mainly in energy taxis (Collins et  al., 2014). 
  Identification of the ligand for MtpA is currently underway.
  MtpB was found to depend on MDH activity and La3+ (Figure 4). 
  Its cellular localization changed in response to La3+ (Figure 1E), which 
  is unique, as well as reasonable to detect the MDH activity that operate 
  in the periplasm. The molecular mechanism that regulates and alters 
  the protein localization is unknown. As one of the examples of 
  differential localization of MCP protein, the Azospirillum brasilense 
  aerotaxis sensor AerC exhibits different localization: the cell pole in 
  the nitrogen fixation condition and the cytosol in the presence of 
  ammonium (Xie et  al., 2010). The dCache_1 domain generally 
  recognizes various compounds, and majority of known ligands are 
  amino acids (Upadhyay et al., 2016). Because its activity depends on 
  MDH activity, the ligand for MtpB is not methanol itself. MDH genes 
  (mxaFI and xoxF1) are associated with solute-binding protein genes 
  (mxaJ and xoxJ) in each cluster. mxaJ deletion in M. extorquens AM1 
  resulted in disruption of MxaFI activation (Amaratunga et al., 1997). 
  MxaJ is suggested to be crucial for MxaFI maturation, however, its 
  exact role is unknown. On the other hand, solute binding proteins are 
  known to function as ligands for many different types of signal 
  transduction receptors, including MCPs that contain dCache, HBM 
  or TarH domains (Matilla et al., 2021). Therefore, it is possible that the 
  ligand for MtpB is XoxJ. MtpB is also involved in formtaxis and 
  ethanol-taxis (Supplementary Figure S8) due to the formaldehyde and 
  ethanol oxidation capacity of XoxF1. Ethanol is released from plants 
  (Fall, 1999), and is also a good growth substrate for strain 22A 
  (Yanpirat et al., 2020). Most probably, ethanol-taxis is dependent on 
  MtpB and XoxF1 or ExaF activity. As we  reported previously,

  analysis of variance followed by Dunnet’s test to compare the differences against wild-type data. p values lower than 0.01 are indicated by asterisks.

  Ln3+-dependent methylotrophy is completely conserved in the genera 
  whereas some strains lack the mxa cluster (Alessa et al., 2021), and 
  XoxF-type MDH is considered to be  ancestral to MxaF-type 
  MDH. Therefore, it is reasonable that MtpB monitoring XoxF1 activity 
  is conserved widely in the genera (Supplementary Table S1). MtpB is 
  relatively less conserved in clade D members that have relatively 
  smaller genomes as well as smaller numbers of MCPs. Clade D 
  contains specialized forest tree phyllospheric members (Leducq et al., 
  2022) that may have limited access to Ln3+.
  MtpC was found to be associated with MxaF activity (Figure 4). 
  Its expression is independent of mxaF expression but dependent on 
  mxbD, which regulates mxaF expression in the absence of La3+ 
  (Figure  6). Thus, mxbD regulates not only MxaF-dependent 
  methylotrophy but also methylotaxis when Ln3+ is not available. As 
  one of the similar regulators, ArcA from avian pathogenic E. coli also 
  controls chemotaxis as well as metabolism and motility (Jiang et al., 
  2015). Because MtpC cellular localization did not change in response 
  to La3+, and its amino acid sequence does not contain any known 
  domains, its mode of action may differ from that of MtpB. MtpC will 
  not bind methanol directly as a ligand, and it is unknown how MtpC 
  activity cooperates with MxaF activity. MtpC appeared randomly 
  across the type strain genomes but not in the strains that lack mxa 
  genes (M. tardum NBRC 103632T, M. longum DSM 23933T, 
  M. persicinum NBRC 103628T, M. komagatae DSM 19563T, and 
  M. iners DSM 19015T; Supplementary Table S1, Alessa et al., 2021), 
  implying the functional and evolutionary link between MtpC 
  and MxaFI.
  Thus, strain 22A is equipped with as many as three distinct MCPs 
  that enable its methylotaxis with different mechanisms. They navigate 
  the cells to the niche where methanol is more available by monitoring 
  FIGURE 6
  A schematic representation of the putative mechanism of strain 22A methylotaxis. Methanol released by plants is oxidized to formaldehyde in the 
  periplasm by either MxaF (with its beta subunit, MxaI) or XoxF1 depending on the availability of Ln3+. MtpA localizes in the cytosol and presumably 
  recognizes formaldehyde as a ligand. MtpB is induced in the presence of Ln3+, and its activity is coupled with XoxF activity. MtpC is induced in the 
  absence of Ln3+, and its activity is coupled with MxaF activity directly or indirectly. The expression of MtpC and MxaF is regulated under the control of 
  MxbDM. The signals were integrated and transmitted to Che proteins that control the direction of flagellar rotation, resulting in methylotaxis and 
  successful cell gathering to plants.

  the cellular methanol oxidation and its product formaldehyde, 
  depending on which MDH is operating in response to the availability 
  of Ln3+. A schematic representation of possible methylotaxis 
  mechanisms in strain 22A is provided in Figure 6.
  Many kinds of plant-derived chemicals, including organic acids, 
  amino acids, phenolics, and sugars, support plant-associated 
  bacterial survival (Chaparro et  al., 2013). They have also been 
  identified as cues for bacteria chemotaxis to locate the plants (Feng 
  et al., 2018). Within such a wide variety of chemotaxis, we propose 
  that methylotaxis is one of the crucial steps for methylotrophs to 
  initiate symbiosis. Further investigation of ligand identification for 
  methylotaxis MCPs, the roles of many other sensors encoded in the 
  strain 22A genome, and the identification of other types of 
  methylotaxis sensors in the other Methylobacterium species will 
  contribute to revealing the eco-physiological and evolutionary 
  versatility of Methylobacterium species.
  Materials and methods
  Strains and culture conditions
  M. aquaticum strain 22A (FERM-BP11078, Tani et al., 2012) was 
  used for MCP identification. Other Methylobacterium type strains 
  were also tested for methylotaxis. Methylobacterium strains were 
  usually grown on R2A medium or mineral medium (MM; Alamgir 
  et al., 2015) containing 0.5% methanol or 0.5% succinate, or both. 
  Kanamycin (25 mg/L) and 1 μM LaCl3 were added when necessary. 
  For growth experiments, strain 22A and its derivatives were grown on 
  200 μl medium prepared in 96-well plates, which were rotary-shaken 
  at 300 rpm at 28°C. The growth was monitored by measuring optical 
  density at 600 nm using a microplate reader (PowerScan HT, DS 
  Pharma). MeOH-La and MeOH+La conditions refer to MM medium 
  containing 0.5% methanol in the absence and presence of 1 μM LaCl3, 
  respectively. E. coli DH5α was used for plasmid construction and 
  E. coli S17-1 was used for conjugation, and they were grown on 
  LB medium.
  Gene knockouts
  Gene knockout mutants for methanol dehydrogenases, that is, 
  ΔmxaF, ΔxoxF1, ΔxoxF1Sup and ΔmxaFΔxoxF1, and mxbD, 
  were generated in our previous studies (Masuda et  al., 2018; 
  Yanpirat et al., 2020). Gene knockout mutants for MCP genes were 
  generated using an allele-replacement vector pK18mobSacB, as 
  previously reported (Alamgir et  al., 2015). In brief, the gene 
  knockout vectors were constructed so that the vector contains 
  tandem ligated each approximately 1 kb upstream and downstream 
  regions of the gene to be  deleted, using the primers listed in 
  Supplementary Table S2 and the In-Fusion Cloning kit (Takara 
  Bio Co.). The vector was introduced into strain 22A via 
  conjugation using E. coli S17-1. Single-crossover mutants were 
  selected by kanamycin resistance, and double-crossover mutants 
  were selected by sucrose resistance. Polymerase chain reaction 
  diagnosis was carried out as described previously (Alamgir 
  et al., 2015).
  Chemotaxis assay
  The cells grown on solid medium overnight were collected with a 
  scraper, suspended in 2 to 3 ml of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (OD600 = 0.01) 
  in 15-ml tube, and incubated at 20°C for 2 h. Capillaries were made of 
  a glass capillary (with filament, model GD-1, Narishige), with a glass 
  puller (Narishige Model PC-10) so that the tip diameter becomes 10 
  to 20 μm. NuSieve GTG agarose (Lonza Bioscience, Co.) was dissolved 
  in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (15 mg/ml) at 50°C. Methanol (and other 
  substances) was added at the desired concentration (2% v/v or w/v, 
  otherwise stated) and the solution was kept at 50°C under seal. When 
  formaldehyde was used as a chemoattractant, 35 mg paraformaldehyde 
  was dissolved in 175 μl 10 mM HEPES pH 7.0 and incubated at 120°C 
  for 15 min, and the solution was regarded as 20% (w/v) formaldehyde. 
  The capillary tip was soaked in the solution for 5 s, and rinsed with 
  water. A sheet of FastWell™ (2 mm thickness, 20 mm diameter, Grace 
  Bio-Labs) was placed on a slide glass, and the 170 μl cell suspension 
  was pipetted into the well. The density of the cell suspension was 
  appropriately adjusted so that 50 to 100 cells are evident in the 
  microscopic window. A cover glass was placed offset, allowing a 
  capillary inserted between the FastWell and the cover glass. The 
  bacteria gathering at the capillary tip were monitored with a light 
  microscope (×200 magnification, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) for 3 or 
  5 min, and pictured every 30 or 60 s (308 × 256 μm, 1,024 × 768 pixels) 
  with a digital camera (VB-7010, Keyence). The cells in a frame were 
  counted with ImageJ software (Schneider et al., 2012). Automatic cell 
  counting was carried out with a macro containing the “Otsu” 
  thresholding and “analyze particles” command. The assay was done in 
  technical triplicates at least. The time-dependent gathering data were 
  used to determine the intensity (gathering speed) of chemotaxis by 
  measuring the slopes of the plots.
  Chemotaxis toward plant tissues
  The gathering and adhesion of strain 22A cells to rice or 
  Arabidopsis thaliana roots were assessed as follows in technical 
  triplicate. A. thaliana col-0 seeds were surface-sterilized with 70% 
  ethanol (2 min), 7% sodium hypochlorite containing 0.2% Triton 
  X-100 (8 min), and thorough washing with sterile water. The seeds 
  were allowed to germinate on 1/2 Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium in 
  square plates (14 cm × 10 cm) solidified with 1.2% agar at 23°C, for 
  20 days (12 h light/dark cycle). The plates were set vertically to allow 
  the roots to grow on the agar surface. The plants were removed, 
  weighed, and rinsed with 10 mM HEPES pH 7.0. The root part only 
  was soaked in 5 ml strain 22A cell suspension (OD600 = 0.01, 10 mM 
  HEPES, pH 7.0, pre-grown in MeOH-La condition for 2 days) 
  prepared in 6-well plates (1 plant/well). At appropriate intervals within 
  0 to 20 (or 60) min, the root was transferred into 1 ml HEPES buffer 
  in 1.5 ml tubes and homogenized with a pestle. The homogenates were 
  serially diluted with 10 mM HEPES pH 7.0, and 10 μl of the dilutes 
  were spread onto solid MM containing 0.5% methanol. The bacterial 
  colony forming units (CFUs) were determined after 5 days of 
  incubation at 28°C.
  The experiment using rice roots was carried out similarly. Rice 
  seeds were dehulled, soaked in 70% ethanol for 3 min, and incubated 
  in 3% sodium hypochlorite containing 0.5% tween 20 at 80°C for 
  30 min. The rice seeds (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) were put on 0.8%

  agar and allowed to grow at 28°C for 10 days. The excised rice roots 
  were incubated in bacterial cell suspension and transferred into 5 ml 
  HEPES containing 0.05% Sylwet (BioMedical Science, Tokyo) and 
  vigorously vortexed for 10 s to remove the cells.
  The density (CFU/ml) of the cell suspension (5 ml) was wild type 
  2.5 ± 0.63 × 105 and TM 3.2 ± 0.26 × 105 in the Arabidopsis experiment, 
  and wild type 2.0 ± 0.18 × 106 and TM 1.4 ± 0.21 × 106 in rice experiment.
  A young leaf of A. thaliana grown as above was excised and put 
  onto a slide glass, onto which strain 22A cell suspension was added. 
  The bacterial cells were observed under a stereo microscope 
  (Olympus MVX10).
  Quantification and observation of 
  mVenus-labeled cells on red perilla leaves
  The DNA fragment encoding mVenus protein was amplified by 
  polymerase chain reaction using pDAS2V (Takeya et al., 2018) as a 
  template and cloned into the EcoRI-digested pAT02m (Yanpirat et al., 
  2020) by the In-Fusion cloning kit. The plasmid, pAT02-V, was 
  introduced into strains 22A and TM by electroporation (2 kV, 25 μF, 
  200 Ω) using a Gene Pulser Xcell (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, 
  CA). Red perilla (Perilla frutescens crispa [Thunb.] Makino) seeds 
  were sterilized with 70% ethanol for 1 min, and with 1% sodium 
  hypochlorite (containing 0.3% Tween 20) for 1 min, then washed with 
  sterilized water 5 times. Strains 22A and TM were cultivated in MM 
  containing 0.5% methanol and 20 μg/ml kanamycin for 2 days at 28°C 
  and cells were collected, washed with sterilized water, and suspended 
  in sterilized water to obtain cell suspensions with OD610 of 0.1. The 
  sterilized red perilla seeds were soaked in the cell suspension of strains 
  22A or TM for 3 h with gentle shaking at 2 rpm using a Rotator RT-5 
  (Taitec, Saitama, Japan) at room temperature. The treated seeds were 
  sown onto Hoagland agar (culture dish, 100 mm × 40 mm, with porous 
  film seal) and aseptically grown in a chamber (NK Biotron LH-220S, 
  Nippon Medical and Chemical Instruments, Osaka, Japan) for 
  112 days. The system was operated at 25°C under a 16 h light and 8 h 
  dark cycle.
  Fresh leaves were removed from the perilla plants aseptically, put 
  into a 1.5 ml tube, and weighed. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was 
  added to the tube (100 μl/10 mg leaf) and vigorously mixed with a Vortex 
  mixer for 15 min. The 30 μl of suspension and 30 μl of AccuCheck 
  Counting Beads (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA) were added to 300 μl of 
  PBS, and mVenus-labeled cells were counted by flow cytometry 
  (FACSAria IIIu, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). For observation by 
  fluorescence microscopy, one fresh leaf was impressed onto a solid MM 
  containing 0.5% methanol and 20 μg/ml kanamycin for 1 min. After 
  removal of the leaf, the plates were incubated for several days at 28°C and 
  colonies were observed with a fluorescence stereo-microscope (Olympus 
  SZ16) equipped with a digital charge-coupled device camera (Olympus 
  DP80) and a YFP filter (Olympus SZX2-FYFPHQ).
  Promoter-reporter assay
  The polymerase chain reaction–generated DNA of the mtpC 
  promoter region (upstream non-coding region of the gene, 455 bp) was 
  cloned into the NcoI site on pAT06-Lux that is a promoter-less bacterial 
  luciferase reporter vector (Juma et al., 2022). The vector (pAT06-PmtpC) 
  was introduced into strain 22A derivatives via conjugation using E. coli 
  S17-1 and selected on kanamycin. The transformants were grown in 
  200 μl MM containing methanol or succinate or both, in the presence or 
  absence of LaCl3. The culture OD600 and luminescence were measured 
  with a microplate reader (PowerScan HT, DS Pharma). The promoter 
  activity was regarded as the luminescence / OD600 when the luminescence 
  reached a maximum during the cultivation.
  Cellular MCP localization analysis
  To observe the cellular localization of MCPs, mtpA (maq22A_
  c14925), mtpB (maq22A_1p32440), and mtpC (maq22A_c15300) 
  genes with their promoter region were cloned in tandem with the GFP 
  gene into the PstI site of pCM130KmC (Yanpirat et al., 2020) using the 
  In-Fusion technique and the primers listed in Supplementary Table S2 
  to generate pCM130KmC-MtpA (or MtpB and MtpC)-GFP. The 
  plasmids were transferred into strain 22A wild type or TM via 
  conjugation by E. coli S17-1 and grown on 0.5% methanol in MM for 
  1 day. The cells were subjected to confocal microscopic observation 
  (FV1000, Olympus). As a control, the GFP ORF fragment (without its 
  promoter) was cloned into pCM130KmC.
  Gene complementation
  The methylotaxis protein genes and their promoter regions were 
  each PCR-amplified with the primers listed in Supplementary Table S2, 
  and cloned into EcoRI site of pAT01 that enables His-tagged protein 
  expression in M. aquaticum strain 22A (Fujitani et  al., 2022). 
  We introduced termination codon in the 3′ primers to avoid possible 
  MCP activity interference by the tag. The vectors were each introduced 
  into TM, and the transformants were grown on methanol in the 
  presence and absence of LaCl3 and subjected to methylotaxis assay.
  Methylotaxis MCP homologs in 
  Methylobacterium genomes
  We sought MCP genes in the genomes of 62 Methylobacterium 
  type strains using 52 amino acid sequences of strain 22A MCPs by 
  BlastP (40% identity threshold). We found 1,467 MCP genes in total. 
  MCPs with more than 60% identity to strain 22A methylotaxis MCPs 
  were counted as methylotaxis MCP homologs.
  Statistical analysis
  The statistical analysis of data (Student’s t-test and analysis of 
  variance) was carried out using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., 
  CA, USA).

  Abstract:Deep generative models produce data
  according to a learned representation, e.g. diffusion
  models, through a process of approximation
  computing possible samples. Approximation can be
  understood as reconstruction and the large datasets
  used to train models as sets of records in which we
  represent the physical world with some data
  structure (photographs, audio recordings,
  manuscripts). During the process of reconstruction,
  e.g., image frames develop each timestep towards a
  textual input description. While moving forward in
  time, frame sets are shaped according to learned
  bias and their production, we argue here, can be
  considered as going back in time; not by inspiration
  on the backward diffusion process but
  acknowledging culture is specifically marked in the
  records. Futures of generative modelling, namely in
  film and audiovisual arts, can benefit by dealing
  with diffusion systems as a process to compute the

  ## Page 4

  future by inevitably being tied to the past, if
  acknowledging the records as to capture fields of
  view at a specific time, and to correlate with our
  own finite memory ideals. Models generating new
  data distributions can target video production as
  signal processors and by developing sequences
  through timelines we ourselves also go back to
  decade-old algorithmic and multi-track
  methodologies revealing the actual predictive
  failure of contemporary approaches to synthesis in
  moving image, both as relevant to composition and
  not explanatory.

  Methylobacterium species colonize plant surfaces and utilize methanol emitted from plants. Methylobacterium aquaticum
  strain 22A was isolated from a hydroponic culture of a moss, Racomitrium japonicum, and is a potent plant growth promoter.
  The complete genome sequencing of the strain conﬁrmed the presence of genes related to plant growth promotion and
  methylotrophy.

  ethylobacterium species are known as one of the predominant bacterial species that inhabit plant surfaces (1). Plants
  emit methanol as a product of pectin demethylation (2). The
  methylotrophic characteristics of the genus confer an advantage
  for survival in the phyllosphere (3). Some species have been reported to be capable of promoting plant growth (4, 5). Methylobacterium aquaticum strain 22A was isolated from a hydroponic
  culture sample of Racomitrium japonicum and shown to be a potent growth promoter for various plants (5). The strain belongs to
  a new lineage of the genus Methylobacterium, because its 16S
  rRNA gene sequence showed low homology with that of its closest
  type strain, M. aquaticum (98.506%) (6). The genome of strain
  22A was completely sequenced in this work.
  Genome sequencing of the fragment library (size, 900 bp; total,
  146 million bp; 316,194 reads) and paired-end library (size, 8 kbp;
  total, 69 million bp; 156,789 reads) was performed using the FLX
  454 genome sequencer. Additional sequencing data were obtained
  with an Illumina 500-bp paired-end library (117 million bp,
  816,704 reads). Assembly was done with Newbler version 3.0, resulting in 9 scaffolds with 134 contigs at 47 coverage. Gaps were
  closed in silico using GenoFinisher (7) and by sequencing of the
  PCR products bridging the scaffolds and contigs. Finally, the total
  genome size was found to be 7,557,960 bp (GC content, 69.1%),
  with a circular chromosome (5,348,274 bp; GC content, 71.1%)
  and ﬁve circular plasmids (i.e., pMaq22A-1, 1,571,989 bp [70.9%
  GC content]; pMaq22A-2, 462,889 bp [67.5% GC content];
  pMaq22A-3, 85,702 bp [67.8% GC content]; pMaq22A-4,
  50,170 bp [70.3% GC content]; and pMaq22A-5, 38,936 bp
  [66.72% GC content]).
  The identiﬁcation of protein-coding sequences (CDSs) and
  annotation were carried out using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome
  Annotation
  Pipeline
  (PGAP)
  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
  /genome/annotation_prok/) and the Microbial Genome Annotation Pipeline (MiGAP) (http://www.migap.org). The CDSs that
  were inconsistent between the two pipelines were manually corrected using GenomeMatcher (7). The predicted number of CDSs
  was 6,944. Ten rrn operons were found in the chromosome and
  one in pMaq22A-1. Eighty-three tRNA genes were found in the
  chromosome, and 12 were in pMaq22A-1. Thus, it may be possible to consider pMaq22A-1 the second chromosome.
  We identiﬁed almost all important genes encoding proteins
  involved in methylotrophy (8, 9): methanol dehydrogenases (MxaFI and XoxF), methylotrophy regulatory proteins (MxcQE and
  MxbDM), and PQQ synthesis enzymes (PqqA1A2BCDE, pqqA
  gene is duplicated, and PqqFG are encoded in distant loci). We
  also identiﬁed the genes important for interaction with plants:
  trans-zeatin production (miaA), cobalamin synthesis (cob),
  1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (acdS), siderophore production (rhbC), and ﬁve copies of ﬂagellin genes (ﬂaLabcde), but no nitrogenase gene. Nif genes were found in nitrogenﬁxing Methylobacterium nodulans and Methylobacterium populi
  (10, 11), which is consistent with the fact that this strain is not
  diazotrophic. The functions of these genes are under investigation. The genome information of the strain will allow both further
  functional and comparative genome analyses among the genus
  Methylobacterium and the establishment of a novel species to
  which the strain belongs to as a new lineage.
  Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The complete genome data have been deposited in DDBJ under the accession
  numbers AP014704 to AP014709. The versions described in this
  paper are the ﬁrst versions, AP014704.1 to AP014709.1.

  Abstract
  Interactions between crustal and mantle reservoirs dominate the
  surface inventory of volatile elements over geological time,
  moderating atmospheric composition and maintaining a lifesupporting planet1. While volcanoes expel volatile components into
  surface reservoirs, subduction of oceanic crust is responsible for
  replenishment of mantle reservoirs2,3. Many natural, ‘superdeep’
  diamonds originating in the deep upper mantle and transition zone
  host mineral inclusions, indicating an affinity to subducted oceanic
  crust4,5,6,7. Here we show that the majority of slab geotherms will
  intersect a deep depression along the melting curve of carbonated

  ## Page 3

  oceanic crust at depths of approximately 300 to 700 kilometres,
  creating a barrier to direct carbonate recycling into the deep
  mantle. Low-degree partial melts are alkaline carbonatites that are
  highly reactive with reduced ambient mantle, producing diamond.
  Many inclusions in superdeep diamonds are best explained by
  carbonate melt–peridotite reaction. A deep carbon barrier may
  dominate the recycling of carbon in the mantle and contribute to
  chemical and isotopic heterogeneity of the mantle reservoir.

  Editorial Summary
  Carbonate recycling into the deep mantle

  ## Page 22

  Andrew Thomson et al. present experiments showing that
  carbonated oceanic crust subducting into the mantle will intersect
  the melting curve at depths of about 300 to 700 km, creating a
  barrier to direct carbonate recycling into the deep mantle. The lowdegree partial melts produced would be highly reactive with
  reduced ambient mantle, producing diamond. The authors conclude
  that this deep carbon barrier may dominate the recycling of carbon
  in the mantle and contribute to chemical and isotopic heterogeneity
  of the mantle reservoir.

  Methylobacterium and Methylorubrum species are facultative methylotrophic bacteria
  that are abundant in the plant phyllosphere. They have two methanol dehydrogenases,
  MxaF and XoxF, which are dependent on either calcium or lanthanides (Lns),
  respectively. Lns exist as insoluble minerals in nature, and their solubilization and uptake
  require a siderophore-like substance (lanthanophore). Methylobacterium species have
  also been identiﬁed as plant growth-promoting bacteria although the actual mechanism
  has not been well-investigated. This study aimed to reveal the roles of siderophore in
  Methylobacterium aquaticum strain 22A in Ln uptake, bacterial physiology, and plant
  growth promotion. The strain 22A genome contains an eight-gene cluster encoding
  the staphyloferrin B-like (sbn) siderophore. We demonstrate that the sbn siderophore
  gene cluster is necessary for growth under low iron conditions and was complemented
  by supplementation with citrate or spent medium of the wild type or other strains
  of the genera. The siderophore exhibited adaptive features, including tolerance to
  oxidative and nitrosative stress, bioﬁlm formation, and heavy metal sequestration. The
  contribution of the siderophore to plant growth was shown by the repressive growth of
  duckweed treated with siderophore mutant under iron-limited conditions; however, the
  siderophore was dispensable for strain 22A to colonize the phyllosphere. Importantly, the
  siderophore mutant could not grow on methanol, but the siderophore could solubilize
  insoluble Ln oxide, suggesting its critical role in methylotrophy. We also identiﬁed TonBdependent receptors (TBDRs) for the siderophore–iron complex, iron citrate, and Ln,
  among 12 TBDRs in strain 22A. Analysis of the siderophore synthesis gene clusters
  and TBDR genes in Methylobacterium genomes revealed the existence of diverse types
  of siderophores and TBDRs. Methylorubrum species have an exclusive TBDR for Ln
  uptake that has been identiﬁed as LutH. Collectively, the results of this study provide
  insight into the importance of the sbn siderophore in Ln chelation, bacterial physiology,
  and the diversity of siderophore and TBDRs in Methylobacterium species.

  Methylobacterium aquaticum Lanthanophore/Siderophore
  INTRODUCTION
  Methylobacterium
  and
  Methylorubrum
  species
  are
  pinkpigmented bacteria capable of utilizing a variety of C1
  compounds (Vuilleumier et al., 2009). These bacteria can
  colonize a wide range of environments and are among the
  most abundant bacterial genera associated with the plant
  phyllosphere (Knief et al., 2010). Their phyllospheric abundance
  can be attributed to their methylotrophy and the presence
  of methanol, which is produced mainly as a byproduct of
  plant pectin metabolism during cell wall synthesis (Fall and
  Benson, 1996). The contribution of methanol to the colonization
  was demonstrated by the reduced colonization capability of
  methylotrophy-deﬁcient
  Methylorubrum
  extorquens
  strain
  AM1 mutants (Sy et al., 2005). Therefore, methylotrophy
  provides a selective advantage to the genus over other bacterial
  genera in the phyllosphere. Furthermore, the phyllosphere
  colonization by Methylobacterium species has been shown to
  vary with plant species, session, and growth stage (Omer et al.,
  2004). Methylobacterium species have also been identiﬁed as
  plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) (Tani et al., 2015;
  Yurimoto et al., 2021) that enhance plant abiotic stress tolerance
  (Kumar et al., 2019).
  Methylobacterium species have been extensively studied for
  methylotrophy in Gram-negative bacteria. Methanol is oxidized
  to formaldehyde by pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent
  methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs) (Anthony, 2004). Generally,
  MDHs are classiﬁed into two types, MxaF and XoxF, which
  utilize calcium and lanthanide (Ln) as cofactors, respectively
  (Keltjens et al., 2014). Ln acts as the transcriptional activator that
  induces the XoxF-MDH while repressing MxaF-MDH (Haque
  et al., 2015). XoxF-MDH is more commonly conserved among
  Methylobacterium species than MxaF-MDH, projecting Ln as an
  integral mineral for methylotrophy (Alessa et al., 2021).
  In nature, Ln occurs as mineral rocks that solubilize in
  sub-nanomolar concentration (Brown et al., 1990). Ln must
  be transported to the cytosol for Ln-dependent methanol
  metabolism to occur. A total of 10 genes, including TonBdependent receptor (TBDR) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-
  type transporter analogous to the siderophore-mediated iron
  transport system, have been identiﬁed in the traﬃcking of Ln
  in M. extorquens strain AM1 (Roszczenko-Jasi´nska et al., 2020).
  Based on the inevitable need to enhance the bioavailability
  of Ln and the similarity of Ln-iron uptake systems, an Ln
  chelator termed lanthanophore has been fronted. Recently, gene
  candidates for lanthanophore biosynthesis [lanthanide chelation
  cluster (LCC)] were identiﬁed in strain AM1. The LCC cluster
  resembled the genes for aerobactin synthesized in Grimontia
  hollisae. However, the LCC cluster does not encode a complete
  gene set for aerobactin synthesis. Therefore, the product of LCC
  lanthanophore should be chemically and structurally diﬀerent
  from aerobactin, although the chemically synthesized aerobactin
  siderophore was shown to bind Ln (Zytnick et al., 2022).
  Bacteria rely on siderophores to acquire iron. Siderophores
  are low-molecular-weight compounds (200–2,000 Da) with a
  high aﬃnity for iron (Ahmed and Holmström, 2014). They are
  structurally diverse and classiﬁed into three main families based
  on characteristic functional groups hydroxamate, catecholate,
  and hydroxycarboxylate (Sah and Singh, 2015). Siderophores also
  form stable complexes with other metal cations (Neubauer et al.,
  2000), sequester heavy metals (Chaturvedi et al., 2012), regulate
  oxidative stress (Adler et al., 2012), and provide antibacterial
  activity (Braun et al., 2009). Once iron is chelated, the complex
  is transported through a TBDR utilizing energy that is derived
  from the proton motive force and transmitted from the TonBExbB-ExbD proteins (Noinaj et al., 2010). TBDRs have also been
  reported to transport vitamin B12, saccharides, and aromatic
  compounds (Fujita et al., 2019).
  Siderophore production is one of the important bacterial
  functions in plant–bacteria and bacteria–bacteria interaction
  (Kramer et al., 2021); however, it has not been characterized well
  in Methylobacterium species and few strains in the genus have
  been reported to synthesize siderophores (Lacava et al., 2008).
  The recent ﬁnding of the aerobactin-like LCC gene cluster in
  strain AM1 showed that siderophores can play a critical role in
  Ln acquisition, which leads to the induction and activation of a
  novel enzyme, Ln-dependent XoxF-type MDHs. The mechanism
  for Ln-dependent expression switching (Ln-switch) between
  Ca2+-dependent MxaF and Ln-dependent XoxF is an important
  research topic in bacterial methylotrophy, and the elucidation of
  the siderophore function as lanthanophore is crucial to dissecting
  the molecular mechanism of Ln-switch.
  The genera Methylobacterium and Methylorubrum are diverse,
  comprising 63 species and categorized into three major clades,
  A, B, and C. Clade C has a diﬀerent methylotrophy gene
  repertoire, including a lack of mxaF in some strains, signifying
  the importance of the uptake of Ln in this group. This clade
  also has a diﬀerent set of genes for C1 compound metabolism,
  such as the glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase
  pathway (Yanpirat et al., 2020), and is characterized by a high GCrich genome (Alessa et al., 2021). Methylobacterium aquaticum
  strain 22A was isolated from Racomitrium japonicum (Tani et al.,
  2012). The strain belongs to clade C and its complete genome
  information is available (Tani et al., 2016). Strain 22A has plant
  growth promotion capability, although the mechanism has not
  yet been established. Siderophore is proposed to contribute to
  the plant growth promotion eﬀect. In this paper, we investigate
  the function of the staphyloferrin B-like siderophore from strain
  22A in plant growth promotion, bacterial physiology, and its
  involvement in methylotrophy. Furthermore, we aim to enhance
  knowledge on siderophore synthesis and receptors, using the
  genome information of all type strains of Methylobacterium and
  Methylorubrum species (Alessa et al., 2021).
  RESULTS
  Gene Organization of Siderophore
  Synthesis Cluster in Strain 22A Genome
  The strain 22A genome contains a siderophore synthesis
  cluster
  composed
  of
  eight
  genes
  (Maq22A_c25425
  to
  Maq22A_c25465) with a similarity of 12% to the staphylobactin
  cluster (BGC0000943) according to anti-SMASH analysis.
  The strain 22A siderophore cluster, herein named sbnAH, also showed 33–56% identity to a well-characterized
  hydroxycarboxylate-type staphyloferrin B cluster (sbnA-I) from

  Methylobacterium aquaticum Lanthanophore/Siderophore
  S. aureus (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1)
  (Cheung et al., 2009) and Ralstonia solanacearum (Bhatt and
  Denny, 2004). The N- and C-terminal portions of SbnF of
  strain 22A showed 34 and 33% similarity to sbnE and sbnF
  of S. aureus, respectively, suggesting that sbnE and sbnF are
  fused in strain 22A. Similar gene clusters were also found in six
  other Methylobacterium type strains in a non-taxonomy-speciﬁc
  manner. We hypothesized that the strain 22A sbn cluster
  synthesizes a staphyloferrin B-like siderophore.
  Staphyloferrin B is biosynthesized by the SbnA-SbnI encoded
  by sbn gene cluster in Staphylococcus aureus (Cheung et al., 2009).
  SbnA, SbnB, and SbnG generate L-diaminopropionic acid (LDAP), α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), and citrate, respectively, as the
  siderophore precursors. SbnE condenses citrate and L-DAP to
  citryl-DAP. SbnF condenses citryl-1,2-diaminoethane (DAE) and
  L-DAP to L-DAP-citryl-DAE. SbnC catalyzes the amide linking
  of the precursor and α-KG to produce staphyloferrin B (Cheung
  et al., 2009). The sbn cluster is also proposed to synthesize a noncharacterized siderophore staphylobactin, which is larger than
  staphyloferrin A or B by >300 Da (Dale et al., 2004).
  Characterization of Siderophore Mutants
  of Strain 22A
  The
  spent
  medium
  of
  strain
  22A
  was
  negative
  for
  catecholate and hydroxamate siderophore tests but positive
  for
  hydroxycarboxylate-type
  siderophore
  (Supplementary
  Figure 2A). Knockout mutants for sbnC and sbnF that were
  annotated as iucA/iucC family siderophore biosynthesis proteins
  were constructed to generate 1sbnC, 1sbnF, and 1sbnCF.
  Gene disruptants were also generated for the other individual
  sbn genes and a hypothetical gene (Maq22A_c25465) at the
  distal end of the cluster. Strain 22A wild type showed a positive
  reaction on chrome azurol S (CAS) agar plate, which is indicative
  of siderophore production whereas 1sbnA, 1sbnD, 1sbnF,
  1sbnH, and 1sbnCF were negative (Supplementary Figure 2B).
  The strain 22A sbn gene cluster contains two of the three
  iucA/iucC family genes (sbnC and sbnF) involved in many
  general non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-independent
  siderophore (NIS) biosynthesis. NIS biosynthesis utilizes at least
  one of these enzymes for siderophore synthesis as a crucial
  component (Challis, 2005). Due to this important potential
  role, we used 1sbnCF as a representative siderophore mutant
  throughout this study.
  The 1sbnC showed a reduced CAS reaction and a normal
  growth, whereas 1sbnA, 1sbnD, 1sbnA, 1sbnD, and 1sbnCF
  showed slower growth compared to the wild type, on succinate in
  the presence of 100 µM FeSO4 (Figure 1A). The wild-type spent
  medium complemented the growth of 1sbnCF (Figure 1B),
  suggesting the inability of the siderophore synthesis of 1sbnCF.
  Interestingly, 1sbnCF was able to grow on succinate in the
  presence of iron citrate (>50 µM) (Figure 1C). Furthermore,
  the combined supplementation of FeSO4 (50 µM) and citrate
  rescued 1sbnCF in a citrate concentration-dependent manner
  (Figure 1D). These results suggested that although the sbn
  siderophore contributes to the utilization of FeSO4, strain 22A
  has another mechanism to acquire iron citrate.
  We cloned the promoter region of sbnA (PsbnA, 644 bp) into
  pAT06, a promoter-reporter vector containing bacterial luciferase
  genes as a reporter and introduced it into strain 22A wild type.
  PsbnA showed high activity with 5 µM FeSO4 and low activity
  with 100 µM FeSO4 or the presence of iron citrate (Figure 2).
  This result suggested that sbn expression is induced by low iron
  availability and repressed by iron citrate.
  Siderophore Mediates the Interaction
  With Plants
  Although strain 22A has been identiﬁed as a potential PGPB
  in ﬁeld and pot conditions (Tani et al., 2015), the growth
  promotion mechanism has not yet been studied. We assessed the
  contribution of siderophore to this plant–bacterial interaction.
  We used duckweed (Lemna gibba p8L) as a plant model.
  Strain 22A wild type and 1sbnCF were inoculated into 1/2
  Murashige–Skoog (MS) medium under two iron regimes. The
  wild type and 1sbnCF showed no plant growth promotion under
  suﬃcient iron conditions (10 mg/l) (Figures 3A,B). In ironlimited conditions (1 mg/l), the wild-type strain 22A promoted
  duckweed growth, whereas 1sbnCF suppressed the plant growth.
  These results suggested that the growth promotion eﬀect is
  dependent on iron availability, and the siderophore is directly
  involved in its mechanism.
  The
  treated
  plants
  were
  subjected
  to
  iron
  content
  measurement
  with
  inductively
  coupled
  plasma
  mass
  spectrometry (ICP-MS). The plants in suﬃcient iron conditions
  contained almost constant iron levels irrespective of the
  genotypes of strain 22A (Figure 3C), suggesting that there was
  no competition for iron between the plants and the bacteria.
  In iron-limited conditions where the plants showed relatively
  smaller biomass, the plant iron content was increased by the
  presence of the wild type, suggesting that strain 22A assisted in
  iron acquisition in the plants. In the presence of 1sbnCF, the
  plants contained lower iron compared to the treatment with the
  wild type, and the 1sbnCF cells contained more iron than the
  wild type. These results suggested that the mutant competed with
  the plant for iron. Meanwhile, the bacterial cell mass assessed as
  wet weight in these conditions showed no diﬀerence between the
  wild type and 1sbnCF (Figure 3D).
  The growth promotion eﬀect by the wild type was also
  reproduced in Arabidopsis thaliana, under low iron conditions
  (1 mg/l) (Supplementary Figure 3A), suggesting that the iron
  dependency of the growth promotion eﬀect is not dependent
  on plant species. A. thaliana was inoculated with a rifampicinresistant strain 22A (22A-rif) and a kanamycin-resistant 1sbnCF
  (1sbnCF-km) individually or in co-inoculation under 1 mg/l
  FeSO4 (Supplementary Figure 3B). 1sbnCF-km colonized the
  plant phyllosphere better than 22A-rif in both conditions.
  These results suggested that 1sbnCF could acquire iron in the
  A. thaliana phyllosphere without the siderophore.

  and Ln-Dependent Methylotrophy

  solubilize insoluble Ln. La2O3 was suspended in the spent

  24 h and quantiﬁcation of soluble La. We could detect a 24-folds
  higher amount of La in the wild-type spent medium compared
  to the non-inoculated medium and 1sbnCF spent medium
  (Figure 4A), suggesting that sbn siderophore is involved in Ln
  solubilization and chelation. We also conﬁrmed that >50 µM
  citrate solubilized La2O3 (Figure 4B).
  1mxaF can grow on methanol only in the presence of La3+,
  due to intact XoxF (Masuda et al., 2018). 1mxaF containing the
  PsbnA reporter vector was cultivated on succinate plus methanol
  under various concentrations of LaCl3 and FeSO4. The promoter
  activity was the control level in LaCl3 concentration in the range
  of 0.3–30 µM under both 5 and 50 µM FeSO4 (Figure 4C).
  A high concentration of LaCl3 (90 µM) activated PsbnA under
  5 µM but not under 50 µM FeSO4, suggesting that LaCl3 created
  iron scarcity, increasing the need for siderophore synthesis.

  circles, cell yield (OD600). The results were presented as the
  average ± standard deviation (SD) (biological triplicates).
  To further examine the involvement of siderophore in Ln
  solubilization, we generated 1mxaF1sbnCF. The wild type grew
  on methanol utilizing FeSO4 or iron citrate and either forms
  of La (LaCl3 or La2O3) (Figure 4D). Without the addition of
  an iron source, the wild type could not grow, however, La
  source omission did not aﬀect its growth (data not shown).
  1mxaF growth on methanol was dependent on either of the La
  forms and iron. 1sbnCF and 1mxaF1sbnCF could not grow
  on methanol in all conditions, even under a high concentration
  of iron citrate (100 µM) that could complement their growth
  on succinate (Figure 1C). We also found that 1mxaF1sbnCF
  was able to grow on methanol in the presence of LaCl3 and
  the wild-type spent media (Figure 4E) or with citrate (but not
  iron citrate) in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4F).
  These results suggested that siderophore is not required for
  methylotrophic growth in the presence of citrate, but that it serves
  as an Ln chelator in the absence of citrate, and that citrate also
  chelates Ln for uptake.
  We assessed the promoter activity of MDH genes (xoxF and
  mxaF) in the wild type and 1sbnCF grown on methanol plus
  succinate in the absence/presence of 30 µM LaCl3. The wild type
  showed a clear Ln-dependent switch of MDH gene expression
  (Figure 4G). In the presence of LaCl3, 1sbnCF showed more than
  10 times higher activity of PxoxF than the wild type. Judging from
  the diﬀerence in ﬁnal 1sbnCF cell yield between 0 and 30 µM
  LaCl3, 1sbnCF has methanol oxidation capacity in the presence
  of LaCl3, which means that La3+ uptake occurs by an unknown
  mechanism to activate XoxF. The reason for the high activity of
  PxoxF is unclear, but it is possible that sbn siderophore is involved
  in the maintenance of La3+ concentration in the cells, and the
  resultant high La3+ content in the cells resulted in high induction
  of xoxF.
  Role of Sbn Siderophore in Bioﬁlm
  Formation, Resistance to Reactive
  Oxygen Species, and Heavy Metals

  with iron citrate resulted in bioﬁlm formation in a concentrationdependent manner in 1sbnCF (Supplementary Figure 4A).
  This result suggests that iron availability and siderophore
  production can inﬂuence bioﬁlm formation in strain 22A. We
  could not compare bioﬁlm formation without iron citrate since
  1sbnCF could not grow.
  1sbnCF was more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide (1 mM)
  and sodium nitrite (10 mM) but not to diamide (10 mM)
  compared to the wild type (Supplementary Figure 4B),
  suggesting that siderophore synthesis is involved in resistance to
  the oxidative stress.
  The growth of strain 22A and 1sbnCF in the presence
  of 50 µM iron citrate was not aﬀected by 10 µM ZnSO4,
  CuSO4, NiSO4, and MnSO4 (data not shown). The growth
  of 1sbnCF was inhibited by 100 µM ZnSO4, CuSO4, and
  NiSO4, but no signiﬁcant inhibition was seen on the wild-type
  strain (Figure 5A). Supplementation of wild-type spent media
  to 1sbnCF restored its growth under heavy metals. Higher iron
  concentration (100 µM iron citrate) also alleviated heavy metal
  toxicity in 1sbnCF. sbnA promoter activity in the wild type
  under 100 µM of each heavy metal and two iron concentration
  regimes was examined (Figure 5B). PsbnA showed a control-level
  activity under ZnSO4 and NiSO4, and repressed activity under
  CuSO4 and MnSO4 in the presence of 5 µM FeSO4. In the
  presence of 100 µM FeSO4, the promoter activity was generally
  repressed even in the presence of these metals, but not completely
  repressed in the presence of ZnSO4. The heavy metal content
  measurement revealed higher Zn accumulation and lower Ni
  accumulation in ZnSO4- and NiSO4-treated 1sbnCF compared
  to the wild type, respectively (Figure 5C). The cellular iron
  content in the absence of heavy metals was comparable between
  22A wild type and 1sbnCF when they were grown in the
  presence of iron citrate (Figure 5D). The addition of ZnSO4 or
  CuSO4 reduced, whereas the addition of MnSO4 increased, iron
  accumulation in both strains. The addition of NiSO4 resulted
  in iron accumulation that was similar to that of the control in
  both the wild type and 1sbnCF. Overall, these data suggested
  that sbn siderophore is involved in the heavy metal resistance of

  Variety of Siderophore Biosynthesis
  Clusters in Methylobacterium Species
  We found a total of 66 siderophore synthesis gene clusters
  among 60 genomes of Methylobacterium type strains and strain
  22A through anti-SMASH analysis (Supplementary Table 2).
  They had varied homology to known siderophore gene clusters
  (7–100%) and could be classiﬁed into 10 groups based on
  similarity. A total of 13 species were associated with two or
  more siderophore synthesis clusters. Most of the siderophore
  biosynthesis gene clusters were composed of 6–16 genes (data
  not shown). We found that 41 type strains were positive in
  the CAS agar assay. Although no gene cluster was identiﬁed in
  nine strains, seven of them were positive in the CAS agar assay.
  The malleobactin-like siderophore gene cluster was dominantly
  found in clades A, A1, and A5. The taiwachelin-like siderophore
  gene cluster was found in clade A4 and some members in clade B.
  Clades B2, C1, and C2 members have no dominant siderophore
  gene cluster, and only three species have a staphylobactin-like
  siderophore gene cluster in clade C1, to which M. aquaticum
  belongs. A total of 15 other siderophore gene clusters had
  no similarity to known clusters. Thus, siderophore synthesis
  is a common characteristic among Methylobacterium species,

  62% of the strains with taiwachelin-like siderophore could enable
  iron deﬁciency recovery. All ﬁve strains with an sbn cluster
  could complement the growth of 1sbnCF. R. solanacearum strain
  RS1000, which produces staphyloferrin B (Bhatt and Denny,
  2004), was also able to rescue 1sbnCF. The strains with an sbn
  cluster were all isolated from plants except for M. ajmalii strain
  IF7SW-B2T (Bijlani et al., 2021), implying the possible advantage
  of this type of siderophore in the plant-associated lifestyle.
  Characterization of TonB-Dependent
  Receptors in Strain 22A
  The strain 22A genome encodes 12 TBDRs, among which, those
  for iron-siderophore complex, iron citrate, and possible Lnlanthanophore should exist. We examined the phenotype of the
  gene disruption mutants or deletion mutants of these receptors in
  strain 22A. The 9 TBDR mutants not discussed here did not show
  any phenotypes in these assays.
  TonB-dependent receptor for sbn siderophore: A TBDR gene
  (Maq22A_c25420) was found in the upstream region of the sbn
  gene cluster and named tonB_sbn. 1tonB_sbn showed slower
  growth with FeSO4, and 1sbnCF1tonB_sbn could not grow on
  succinate with FeSO4 and wild-type spent medium (Figure 6A).
  Iron citrate supplementation rescued 1sbnCF1tonB_sbn growth
  (Figure 6B). These results indicated that tonB_sbn is involved in
  the sbn-siderophore-iron complex transport.
  TonB-dependent receptor for iron citrate: We found that
  a gene deletion mutant of Maq22A_c24885, herein named
  1tonB_cit, under a background of 1sbnCF, showed a lag
  phase when grown on succinate with iron citrate (Figure 6B).
  Supplementation of 50 µM citrate and 50 µM FeSO4 also resulted
  in a lag phase (Figure 6C). tonB_cit is therefore involved in iron
  citrate transport. However, the mutant could still grow. There
  may thus be another TBDR that can transport iron citrate or one
  for iron chelated by other substances.

  Maq22A_c14845 (labeled as 1tonB_Ln) under a 1mxaF

  background did not grow on methanol with LaCl3 (Figure 6D).
  The promoter region of tonB_Ln was cloned into pAT06, and
  the promoter activity in the wild type showed lower expression
  in a higher LaCl3 concentration (Figure 6E). This suggests
  that tonB_Ln is involved in Ln transport, and its expression is
  repressed when Ln is well available.
  Variety and Distribution of
  TonB-Dependent Receptors in
  Methylobacterium Genomes
  Using the sequences of the TBDRs in strain 22A and the TBDRs
  found in M. extorquens strain AM1 (LutH, META1p1785,
  and
  TonB_Lcc,
  META1p4129)
  as
  queries,
  we
  searched
  TBDRs encoded in all type strains of Methylobacterium and
  Methylorubrum species (Figure 7 and Supplementary Table 3).
  TBDRs found in the genera were phylogenetically classiﬁed into
  25 clusters, and each strain had 7–23 TBDRs in its genome.
  TonB_sbn is homologous to TonB_Lcc of strain AM1 and 52
  other TBDRs. TonB_Ln is phylogenetically close to strain AM1
  LutH and widely conserved with a total of 69 homologs in
  the genera; it is especially enriched in clades A4 and C1. LutH
  has only 10 homologs and is well conserved only in clade B
  (Methylorubrum species) and two clade A1 members. TonB_cit
  was also well conserved (40 homologous TBDRs), suggesting that
  the majority of Methylobacterium species can utilize iron citrate.
  TBDRs in strain 22A are phylogenetically diverse and each of
  them is widely conserved among Methylobacterium species.
  DISCUSSION
  The strain 22A sbn gene cluster showed 33–56% homology to
  sbn genes in S. aureus (Supplementary Table 1). The cluster
  lacks sbnI, whereas sbnE and sbnF are fused in strain 22A. We
  presumed that strain 22A siderophore has a similar structure to
  staphyloferrin B. 1sbnA, 1sbnD, 1sbnF, 1sbnH, and 1sbnCF
  but not 1sbnC showed defective growth on succinate under
  iron deﬁciency. Because SbnC catalyzes the critical ﬁnal step for
  staphyloferrin B synthesis, the intermediate(s) produced without
  SbnC may still be active for iron chelation. SbnF in strain 22A
  (the fused SbnE and SbnF) may be more important to synthesize
  the intermediates. This point will be clariﬁed when we determine
  the siderophore structure and the functions of each gene.
  1sbnCF could not grow well with FeSO4 (Figure 1A), and
  its growth was complemented by the spent medium of the
  wild type or iron citrate (Figures 1B,C). sbn gene expression is
  induced by low iron availability and repressed by iron citrate
  (Figure 2). Citrate has a lower aﬃnity (Kd < 0.260 nM) for iron

  Methylobacterium aquaticum Lanthanophore/Siderophore
  FIGURE 7 | Phylogenetic tree and gene counts of TBDRs found in the genomes of different subclades of Methylobacterium type strains. The phylogenetic tree is
  constructed based on the amino acid sequences of TBDR genes. The Methylobacterium subclade deﬁnition is based on our previous report (Alessa et al., 2021).
  A total of 25 clades are labeled A-Y. The counts of TBDRs and description of characterized TBDRs are indicated in brackets. Details are presented in

  than that of conventional siderophores (Fukushima et al., 2012)
  and acts as a general iron chelator for the bacterial community
  as opposed to individual siderophores (Mazoy et al., 1997).
  Therefore, strain 22A preferably utilizes iron citrate if available,
  without synthesizing sbn siderophore.
  The sbn siderophore of strain 22A is one of the plant
  growth promotion factors (Figure 3). Bacterial siderophore
  supplementation abolishes iron deﬁciency in plants (Crowley
  et al., 1992). Interestingly, 1sbnCF competed with plants for iron,
  which resulted in a low plant iron uptake. Because strain 22A
  can also utilize citrate as a carbon source, and citrate is one of
  the common organic acids in root exudates in response to iron
  deﬁciency (Ling et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 2015), we considered that
  1sbnCF overtook the iron complexed by plant-derived citrate.
  It should be noted that since iron citrate represses siderophore
  production, siderophore synthesis in the wild type precedes the
  plant citrate exudation, and the wild-type strain 22A did not
  become opportunistic. The growth promotion ability of strain
  22A was also observed in A. thaliana in low iron conditions
  (Supplementary Figure 3). The siderophore was not essential
  for strain 22A to colonize the A. thaliana phyllosphere, but in
  return, the plant growth was repressed. Judging from its iron
  accumulation, 1sbnCF can pirate iron citrate that is relatively
  abundant in the phyllosphere (Yokosho et al., 2009; RellánÁlvarez et al., 2010). On the other hand, siderophore synthesis
  was a biological cost in the wild type.
  We found that the sbn siderophore and citrate solubilize
  La2O3 (Figures 4A,B). The sbn siderophore was indispensable in
  the absence of citrate (Figures 4D,E) but was dispensable in the
  presence of citrate (not iron citrate) for XoxF- and Ln-dependent
  methylotrophic growth (Figure 4F). Thus, we concluded that
  the sbn siderophore is another type of “lanthanophore” involved
  in Ln uptake, in addition to the aerobactin-type siderophore in
  M. extorquens strain AM1 (Zytnick et al., 2022). Interestingly,
  sbn siderophore inactivation resulted in the overactivation of
  PxoxF in the presence of LaCl3 (Figure 4G). The expression of
  xoxF and mxaF is regulated by the Ln-switch; therefore, this xoxF
  overexpression indeed suppressed mxaF. It is generally accepted
  that siderophores play a role in the homeostasis of other metals
  other than iron. Most probably, the sbn siderophore plays a role

  not only in controlled Ln uptake but also in maintaining cellular
  Ln homeostasis. The siderophore-free La3+ in the periplasm
  might strongly induce XoxF through activation of MxbDM
  that is a two-component signaling system responsible for the
  expression of MDHs (Yanpirat et al., 2020). The exact reason
  for this high xoxF induction remains to be determined through
  investigation of the Ln-switch; however, here, we can add the sbntype lanthanophore as one of the factors involved in the complex
  switching mechanism.
  Iron concentration inversely impacted the bioﬁlm formation
  in strain 22A wild type. Access to a suﬃcient amount of
  iron could deter bioﬁlm formation since environmental stresses
  such as iron starvation generally trigger bioﬁlm formation
  (Muhammad et al., 2020). This corroborated with other studies
  showing that iron depletion enhanced bioﬁlm formation in
  diﬀerent bacteria including E. coli (Hancock et al., 2008)
  and Cupriavidus necator (Li et al., 2019). In contrast, bioﬁlm
  formation in 1sbnCF was enhanced with an increasing iron
  concentration (Supplementary Figure 4A). Iron is essential for
  bioﬁlm formation (Oliveira et al., 2017) and iron is a limiting
  growth factor for 1sbnCF at the tested iron citrate concentrations
  (Supplementary Figure 4A). The enhanced bioﬁlm formation
  in 1sbnCF by iron citrate suggested that iron acquisition rather
  than sbn siderophore per se was the important determinant.
  1sbnCF showed less tolerance to hydrogen peroxide and
  sodium nitrite (Supplementary Figure 4B), implying that this
  iron uptake system confers tolerance to oxidative stress. Iron
  is a dangerous metal due to its capacity to generate reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) through the Fenton reaction (Corpas
  et al., 2015). Therefore, iron homeostasis could be related to
  oxidative stress (Cornelis et al., 2011). SirA, a staphyloferrin
  B transport system, inﬂuences tolerance to ROS in S. aureus
  (Nobre and Saraiva, 2014). Whereas hydrogen peroxide increases
  intracellular hydroxyl radicals that lead to direct oxidation,
  diamide causes indirect oxidative stress by oxidizing glutathione
  (GSH) and furthering redox imbalance (Toledano et al., 2003).
  Therefore, iron mitigation by sbn siderophore could be ineﬀective
  for such an indirect oxidative stress mechanism.
  The sbn siderophore of strain 22A contributes to heavy metal
  resistance, and the results of the cellular metal accumulation and
  PsbnA activity analyses indicated that toxicity and siderophoremediated resistance mechanisms diﬀer depending on the metal
  species (Figure 5). The heavy metal toxicity was also inﬂuenced
  by the iron concentration. This suggested possibility of uptake
  competition among the metals. ZnSO4 treatment did not have an
  eﬀect on PsbnA activity, caused a high accumulation of Zn2+ in
  1sbnCF, and caused iron scarcity. The scarcity suggested that the
  sbn siderophore binds Zn2+, and hence, the siderophore prevents
  uncontrolled entry of Zn2+ into the cells (Braud et al., 2009).
  CuSO4 treatment repressed PsbnA activity, caused unchanged
  Cu2+ accumulation in the wild type and 1sbnCF, and decreased
  iron content in the wild type. Therefore, copper susceptibility of
  the mutant may include iron scarcity caused by PsbnA repression
  but not Cu2+ accumulation. NiSO4 treatment did not have an
  eﬀect on PsbnA activity and caused a higher accumulation of Ni2+
  in the wild type. Thus, Ni susceptibility of the mutant was not
  caused by Ni accumulation but rather by repressed iron transport
  that is necessary to overcome Ni toxicity. MnSO4 treatment at
  the tested concentration did not cause any growth inhibition in
  the wild type and 1sbnCF, suggesting that the sbn siderophore
  does not take part in the resistance. However, it caused decreased
  PsbnA activity, higher Mn, and iron accumulation in both cells.
  This contradictory decreased PsbnA activity and higher iron
  accumulation could not be explained well only with these
  data. These metals are essential mineral elements that exhibit
  important interactions and possible competitive inhibition of
  transport. The biochemical resistance mechanism in which the
  sbn siderophore participates awaits further characterization of
  the puriﬁed siderophore including its binding capacity and
  identiﬁcation of the transporters for each metal.
  Siderophore production is a common characteristic in
  Methylobacterium
  species
  bearing
  similarity
  and
  disparity
  among groups of individual strains (Supplementary Table 2).
  Malleobactin- and taiwachelin-type siderophore gene clusters
  may have been conserved through their evolution and phylogeny
  whereas the horizontal acquisition of the other siderophore gene
  clusters is dependent on their habitat as opposed to species
  evolution. Other strains of Methylobacterium species, as well
  as R. solanacearum with sbn genes and many taiwachelincontaining strains, were able to rescue 1sbnCF from iron
  starvation. Thus, strain 22A can utilize these xenosiderophores
  from Methylobacterium species and other non-methylotrophic
  bacteria. The diﬀerent types of siderophores and inter-species
  utilization among Methylobacterium species may contribute to
  the speciﬁc species predominance of the genus or even to
  shape the microbial community in diﬀerent niches, especially
  when Methylobacterium comprises one of the most predominant
  species in an environment, such as the phyllosphere.
  Among 12 TBDRs in strain 22A, here, we identiﬁed two
  TBDRs for iron uptake (Figure 6), which may enable the
  strain to more eﬃciently acquire either siderophore-bound or
  citrate-bound iron. The tonB_sbn is used for the uptake of sbn
  siderophore. On the other hand, tonB_cit is more eﬃcient in iron
  citrate uptake; however, another TBDR for iron citrate has not
  yet been identiﬁed. The tonB_Ln is necessary for Ln-dependent
  methylotrophy (Figure 6D). The expression of tonB_Ln was
  repressed with increased Ln concentration (Figure 6E). It
  remains unknown what form of Ln3+ is the substrate for
  tonB_Ln (sbn siderophore-bound Ln3+ or citrate-Ln3+) and
  whether tonB_sbn incorporates sbn siderophore-bound Ln3+
  or not. The Ln3+
  concentration-dependent repression of
  tonB_Ln, which was also found in tonB_LutH in strain AM1
  (Roszczenko-Jasi´nska et al., 2020), suggested that they have
  an Ln3+-sensing mechanism to optimize Ln3+ uptake through
  TBDR regulation.
  TonB_sbn, which is homologous to tonB_Lcc in strain
  AM1, was widely conserved among Methylobacterium species
  (Figure 7). The tonB_Ln and tonB_cit were also well conserved.
  Interestingly, tonB_LutH in strain AM1 was less conserved and
  found only in clade B (Methylorubrum species). The distribution
  of common or clade speciﬁc TBDRs may suggest the possibility
  of chelator sharing or competition among the Methylobacterium
  species. Other non-characterized TBDRs of strain 22A also
  showed a wide range of conservation within Methylobacterium

  MATERIALS AND METHODS
  Microbial Strains and Culture Conditions
  The Methylobacterium species used in this study were grown and
  maintained on an R2A medium or mineral medium containing
  either 0.5% methanol or 0.5% succinate (herein referred to as
  methanol and succinate media), as previously described (Alessa
  et al., 2021). Kanamycin (25 mg/l), rifampicin (20 mg/l), LaCl3
  (30 µM), La2O3 (9 mg/l), FeSO4 (5–100 µM), and iron citrate (5
  or 100 µM) were added when necessary.
  The growth tests were conducted in 200 µl various medium
  prepared in 96-well plates, rotary-shaken at 300 rpm at 28◦C.
  The strains grown on R2A solid media supplemented with iron
  citrate were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 0.9%
  NaCl solution to make a cell suspension (OD600 = 1.0). The cell
  suspension was inoculated to a ﬁnal OD value of 0.02 in the test
  media condition. Growth was monitored by measuring OD600
  using a microplate reader (PowerScan HT, Sumitomo Dainippon
  Pharma, Osaka, Japan).
  The wild type strain 22A was grown in methanol media
  supplemented with 5 µM FeSO4 for 5 days. The cells were
  precipitated at 10,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant was
  ﬁltered using a 0.2-µm membrane ﬁlter. The spent media was
  stored at –20◦C until use. The target strains were grown on 10%
  wild-type spent media in the appropriate media.
  Detection of Siderophore
  Siderophore synthesis was assessed by chrome azurol S (CAS)
  agar assay for all the strains grown in modiﬁed succinate media.
  In brief, succinate media without Fe3+ was mixed with CAS as
  previously described (Louden et al., 2011). Diﬀerent methods
  were used to assess the types of siderophores. Arnow assay
  for catechol-type (Arnow, 1937): 50 µl of culture supernatant,
  50 µl of 0.5 M HCl, and 10 µl reagent (1 g/ml NaNO2 and
  1 g/ml Na2MoO4·2H2O) were mixed. After the formation of
  the yellow color, 90 µl of 0.1 M NaOH was added, resulting in
  the generation of red color. 1,2-dihydroxybenzene was used as a
  standard. Atkin assay for hydroxamate-type (Atkin et al., 1970):
  50 µl of culture supernatant was added to 50 µl of the Atkin
  reagent [0.177 g of Fe(ClO4)3 and 1.43 g HClO4 in 100 ml water].
  After 5 min at room temperature, the appearance of a winered color indicated the presence of hydroxamate siderophore.
  Salicylhydroxamic acid was used as a standard. Vogel test for
  hydroxycarboxylate (Vogel, 1957): the reagent was made by
  adding 20 µl of phenolphthalein to 60 µl of 1 M NaOH and
  topping up to 1 ml with water. In total, 50 µl of culture
  supernatant was mixed with 50 µl of reagent. The disappearance
  of color by the addition of culture supernatant indicated the
  presence of hydroxycarboxylate siderophore.
  Construction of Mutant Strains

  this

  are

  We
  generated

  mutants of strain 22A siderophore synthesis gene cluster,
  1sbnC
  (Maq22A_c25435),
  1sbnF
  (Maq22A_c25445),
  and
  1sbnCF. Similarly, TBDR gene deletion mutants, tonB_cit
  (Maq22A_c24885) and tonB_Ln (Maq22A_c14845), were also
  generated in this study. These gene deletion mutants were
  generated using the allele-replacement vector pK18mobSacB,
  as previously described. Gene disruption mutants of other sbn
  genes (sbnA, sbnB, sbnD, sbnG, sbnH, and Maq22A_c25465) and
  TBDR genes (tonB_sbn (Maq22A_c25420), Maq22A_c06025,
  Maq22A_c08030,
  Maq22A_c21870,

  Maq22A_c27600,
  Maq22A_1p31685,
  Maq22A_1p34825, and Maq22A_1p38180) were also generated
  using pK18mobSacB. In brief, the approximately 600 bp midportion of the target gene was polymerase chain reaction
  (PCR)-ampliﬁed and cloned into the EcoRI site on the
  pK18mobSacB
  vector.
  The
  vectors
  were
  introduced
  into
  strain 22A via conjugation using Escherichia coli S17-1, and
  the kanamycin-resistant mutants were regarded as the gene
  disruption mutants. 1mxaF was generated in our previous study
  (Masuda et al., 2018).
  Construction of Promoter-Reporter
  Vector
  We developed pCM130KmC for general cloning purposes that
  operates in strain 22A from pCM130 (Addgene plasmid #45828,
  Marx and Lidstrom, 2001) in our previous study (Yanpirat et al.,
  2020). A fragment containing an EcoRI site and His-tag coding
  sequence generated by a pair of complementary oligonucleotides
  (pCM130KmCinsert1 and 2, Supplementary Table 3) was
  inserted into the EcoRI site of pCM130KmC with an In-Fusion
  Cloning kit to generate pAT01. Next, we also introduced bacterial
  luciferase (Lux) genes that are PCR-ampliﬁed from pUC18-miniTn7T-Gm-lux (Wehrmann et al., 2017) with LuxC-F and LuxER2 primers into pAT01 to construct a luciferase-reporter vector
  (pAT06-Lux). The PCR-generated promoter regions of sbnA,
  tonB_Ln, xoxF, and mxaF were cloned into the NcoI site on the
  pAT06-Lux vector. The vectors were introduced into strain 22A
  via conjugation using E. coli S17-1 and selected on kanamycin.
  To assess the promoter activity, cells of strain 22A and
  its derivatives transformed with pAT06-Lux containing an
  appropriate promoter were maintained on R2A supplemented
  with 25 mg/l Km. The cells were collected, washed with
  0.9% NaCl solution, and inoculated into appropriate media
  (succinate or methanol or methanol/succinate medium) at a
  ﬁnal concentration of OD600 = 0.02. The culture was replicated
  in white 96-well plates (for luminescence measurement) and
  transparent 96-well plates for bacteria growth assessment. The
  growth conditions were maintained as mentioned above. The
  maximum luminescence was normalized to cell density (OD600)
  and reported as promoter activity.

  Methylobacterium aquaticum Lanthanophore/Siderophore
  (1) Lanthanum uptake. Strain 22A wild type and 1sbnCF
  were grown on succinate-methanol media for 5 days, and their
  spent media was ﬁltered using a 0.2-µm membrane ﬁlter. The
  spent media or varied concentrations of citrate were incubated
  with La2O3 18 mg/l for 24 h at 28◦C under shaking at 300 rpm.
  The sample was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 min, at 25◦C) to
  remove La2O3, and 300 µl of the supernatant was dried at 80◦C
  overnight. The dry weight was measured, and the pellets were
  resuspended in 70% HNO3 and boiled at 100◦C for 1 h. Samples
  were diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 5% HNO3 and analyzed
  by ICP-MS (Agilent 7500cx). Strain 22A wild type, 1sbnCF,
  and 1mxaF1sbnCF were grown in 200 µl methanol medium
  containing La2O3/LaCl3 and iron citrate in 96-well plates. The
  plates were shaken at 28◦C at 300 rpm and the cell growth was
  monitored (OD600) using a microplate reader.
  (2) Oxidative and nitrosative stress resistance. Strain 22A
  wild type and 1sbnCF were inoculated in liquid R2A media
  containing 1 mM hydrogen peroxide, 10 mM sodium nitrite, or
  10 mM diamide and were incubated at 28◦C with continuous
  shaking at 300 rpm for 24 h in liquid R2A media. The samples
  were serial diluted and spread on solid R2A media containing
  100 µM iron citrate for 48 h. The colony-forming units (CFUs)
  per milliliter were evaluated, and the percentage of survival in
  comparison with the unchallenged treatment was calculated.
  (3) Heavy metal tolerance. Strain 22A wild type and 1sbnCF
  were grown in succinate media containing 100 µM of each
  heavy metal in 96-well plates and their growth was monitored
  by measuring OD600. For cellular metal content quantiﬁcation,
  they were grown on succinate in the presence of 25 µM
  of ZnSO4, CuSO4, NiSO4, and MnSO4 for 5 days. The cells
  were harvested and washed three times with phosphate-buﬀered
  saline (PBS) containing 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
  (EDTA) and then six times with PBS. Bacterial pellets were
  desiccated at 100◦C overnight. Thereafter, the samples were
  digested and analyzed with the ICP-MS as described above.
  Iron concentration-dependent heavy metal toxicity was also
  determined by culturing strain 22A and 1sbnCF in a varied
  concentration of iron and the heavy metals (50–100 µM).
  (4) Bioﬁlm assay. Bioﬁlm formation was studied by a modiﬁed
  method by O’Toole (2011). Strain 22A wild type and 1sbnCF
  were cultured in succinate media containing 25 to 100 µM
  FeSO4 and iron citrate prepared in 96-well plates at 28◦C for
  96 h. The content of each well was removed by decantation.
  The wells were then washed three times with PBS (pH 7.3),
  air-dried for 45 min, and stained with 0.1% w/v crystal violet
  solution (200 µl) for 10 min. After three times washing with
  water, 200 µl of 95% ethanol was added, and the absorbance was
  determined at 595 nm.
  Interaction of Strain 22A and Plants
  (1) Plant growth promotion by strain 22A: Single sterilized
  duckweed frond was grown in liquid (5 ml) half-strength
  Murashige and Skoog medium (1/2 MS) under a modiﬁed FeSO4
  concentration of 1 or 10 mg/l. The plants were subjected to
  inoculation of strain 22A wild type and 1sbnCF at a ﬁnal
  concentration of OD600 = 0.01 under aseptic conditions. Surface
  sterilized A. thaliana Col-0 seeds were grown on solid 1/2 MS
  and inoculated with the bacteria as described above. The plants
  were grown at 23◦C with a photoperiod of 16/8 h (light/dark).
  The experiments were conducted in triplicate. After 28 days, the
  plants were transferred into separate 1.5-ml tubes and bacterial
  cells in the media were pelleted at 4,000 × g for 4 min. The plant
  and bacterial cell fresh weight, dry weight, and metal contents
  were determined.
  (2) In planta colonization assay: A rifampicin-resistant
  spontaneous
  mutant
  of
  strain
  22A
  (strain
  22A-rif)
  and
  kanamycin-resistant 1sbnCF (1sbnCF-km) were generated as
  previously described (Alamgir et al., 2015). A. thaliana seeds were
  inoculated with the 5 µl (OD600 = 0.01) of the two strains singly
  or in combination and grown as described previously. A total of
  four seedlings were used for each experiment and replicated three
  times. Then, 5–10 leaves of A. thaliana plants not touching the
  media (200–300 mg fresh weight) were washed in 1.5-ml sterile
  tubes containing 1 ml 0.9% NaCl. Bacteria were dislodged from
  the leaf by shaking (5,000 rpm, 10 min) and sonication (34%
  amplitude, 20 s, Vibra cell, Sonics and Materials Inc.) followed by
  vortexing for 30 s. The resulting suspensions were serially diluted
  and plated onto R2A containing rifampicin or kanamycin for
  CFU determination.
  Characterization of TonB-Dependent
  Receptor in Strain 22A
  A total of 12 TBDRs in strain 22A were assessed for their
  role in iron-sbn siderophore uptake in 96-well plates. The
  mutant strains of the 12 TBDR in wild-type backgrounds were
  grown in succinate media supplemented with 100 µM FeSO4.
  Similarly, the mutants generated under 1sbnCF background
  were cultivated in succinate media supplemented with 50 µM
  FeSO4 and 10% wild-type spent media, or 100 µM iron citrate,
  or 50 µM FeSO4 and 50 µM citrate. The mutant strains of the 12
  TBDR with a background of 1mxaF were also generated to assess
  the TBDR for Ln uptake.
  Analysis of Siderophore Biosynthesis
  Clusters and TonB-Dependent Receptors
  in Methylobacterium Species
  A search for secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes was
  performed for the 60 Methylobacterium species genome to
  predict the siderophore gene cluster using AntiSMASH software
  (version 6.0.1 https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org) (Blin
  et al., 2019). Local BLASTp using the siderophore cluster and
  TBDR genes characterized in strain 22A and (META1p1785
  and META1p4129) in strain AM1 as queries was run against
  the non-redundant protein database of 59 Methylobacterium
  and
  Methylorubrum
  type
  strains
  at
  threshold
  values
  set
  at ≥30% identity.
  Siderophore Cross-Feeding
  1sbnCF cell suspension (OD600 = 0.01) in 0.75% agar was
  overlaid on solid succinate media. A sterilized paper disk (6 mm
  diameter) was placed on the plate, and the test siderophore donor
  strains were inoculated onto it. Colony formation of 1sbnCF

  Data Analysis
  The statistical analysis (one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s
  test or Student’s t-test) of data was carried out using Prism 6
  (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA, United States). Only p-values less
  than a 5% level of signiﬁcance are shown in the ﬁgures.

  Methylobacterium and Methylorubrum species are facultative methylotrophic bacteria
  that are abundant in the plant phyllosphere. They have two methanol dehydrogenases,
  MxaF and XoxF, which are dependent on either calcium or lanthanides (Lns),
  respectively. Lns exist as insoluble minerals in nature, and their solubilization and uptake
  require a siderophore-like substance (lanthanophore). Methylobacterium species have
  also been identiﬁed as plant growth-promoting bacteria although the actual mechanism
  has not been well-investigated. This study aimed to reveal the roles of siderophore in
  Methylobacterium aquaticum strain 22A in Ln uptake, bacterial physiology, and plant
  growth promotion. The strain 22A genome contains an eight-gene cluster encoding
  the staphyloferrin B-like (sbn) siderophore. We demonstrate that the sbn siderophore
  gene cluster is necessary for growth under low iron conditions and was complemented
  by supplementation with citrate or spent medium of the wild type or other strains
  of the genera. The siderophore exhibited adaptive features, including tolerance to
  oxidative and nitrosative stress, bioﬁlm formation, and heavy metal sequestration. The
  contribution of the siderophore to plant growth was shown by the repressive growth of
  duckweed treated with siderophore mutant under iron-limited conditions; however, the
  siderophore was dispensable for strain 22A to colonize the phyllosphere. Importantly, the
  siderophore mutant could not grow on methanol, but the siderophore could solubilize
  insoluble Ln oxide, suggesting its critical role in methylotrophy. We also identiﬁed TonBdependent receptors (TBDRs) for the siderophore–iron complex, iron citrate, and Ln,
  among 12 TBDRs in strain 22A. Analysis of the siderophore synthesis gene clusters
  and TBDR genes in Methylobacterium genomes revealed the existence of diverse types
  of siderophores and TBDRs. Methylorubrum species have an exclusive TBDR for Ln
  uptake that has been identiﬁed as LutH. Collectively, the results of this study provide
  insight into the importance of the sbn siderophore in Ln chelation, bacterial physiology,
  and the diversity of siderophore and TBDRs in Methylobacterium species.

  INTRODUCTION
  Methylobacterium
  and
  Methylorubrum
  species
  are
  pinkpigmented bacteria capable of utilizing a variety of C1
  compounds (Vuilleumier et al., 2009). These bacteria can
  colonize a wide range of environments and are among the
  most abundant bacterial genera associated with the plant
  phyllosphere (Knief et al., 2010). Their phyllospheric abundance
  can be attributed to their methylotrophy and the presence
  of methanol, which is produced mainly as a byproduct of
  plant pectin metabolism during cell wall synthesis (Fall and
  Benson, 1996). The contribution of methanol to the colonization
  was demonstrated by the reduced colonization capability of
  methylotrophy-deﬁcient
  Methylorubrum
  extorquens
  strain
  AM1 mutants (Sy et al., 2005). Therefore, methylotrophy
  provides a selective advantage to the genus over other bacterial
  genera in the phyllosphere. Furthermore, the phyllosphere
  colonization by Methylobacterium species has been shown to
  vary with plant species, session, and growth stage (Omer et al.,
  2004). Methylobacterium species have also been identiﬁed as
  plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) (Tani et al., 2015;
  Yurimoto et al., 2021) that enhance plant abiotic stress tolerance
  (Kumar et al., 2019).
  Methylobacterium species have been extensively studied for
  methylotrophy in Gram-negative bacteria. Methanol is oxidized
  to formaldehyde by pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent
  methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs) (Anthony, 2004). Generally,
  MDHs are classiﬁed into two types, MxaF and XoxF, which
  utilize calcium and lanthanide (Ln) as cofactors, respectively
  (Keltjens et al., 2014). Ln acts as the transcriptional activator that
  induces the XoxF-MDH while repressing MxaF-MDH (Haque
  et al., 2015). XoxF-MDH is more commonly conserved among
  Methylobacterium species than MxaF-MDH, projecting Ln as an
  integral mineral for methylotrophy (Alessa et al., 2021).
  In nature, Ln occurs as mineral rocks that solubilize in
  sub-nanomolar concentration (Brown et al., 1990). Ln must
  be transported to the cytosol for Ln-dependent methanol
  metabolism to occur. A total of 10 genes, including TonBdependent receptor (TBDR) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-
  type transporter analogous to the siderophore-mediated iron
  transport system, have been identiﬁed in the traﬃcking of Ln
  in M. extorquens strain AM1 (Roszczenko-Jasi´nska et al., 2020).
  Based on the inevitable need to enhance the bioavailability
  of Ln and the similarity of Ln-iron uptake systems, an Ln
  chelator termed lanthanophore has been fronted. Recently, gene
  candidates for lanthanophore biosynthesis [lanthanide chelation
  cluster (LCC)] were identiﬁed in strain AM1. The LCC cluster
  resembled the genes for aerobactin synthesized in Grimontia
  hollisae. However, the LCC cluster does not encode a complete
  gene set for aerobactin synthesis. Therefore, the product of LCC
  lanthanophore should be chemically and structurally diﬀerent
  from aerobactin, although the chemically synthesized aerobactin
  siderophore was shown to bind Ln (Zytnick et al., 2022).
  Bacteria rely on siderophores to acquire iron. Siderophores
  are low-molecular-weight compounds (200–2,000 Da) with a
  high aﬃnity for iron (Ahmed and Holmström, 2014). They are
  structurally diverse and classiﬁed into three main families based
  on characteristic functional groups hydroxamate, catecholate,
  and hydroxycarboxylate (Sah and Singh, 2015). Siderophores also
  form stable complexes with other metal cations (Neubauer et al.,
  2000), sequester heavy metals (Chaturvedi et al., 2012), regulate
  oxidative stress (Adler et al., 2012), and provide antibacterial
  activity (Braun et al., 2009). Once iron is chelated, the complex
  is transported through a TBDR utilizing energy that is derived
  from the proton motive force and transmitted from the TonBExbB-ExbD proteins (Noinaj et al., 2010). TBDRs have also been
  reported to transport vitamin B12, saccharides, and aromatic
  compounds (Fujita et al., 2019).
  Siderophore production is one of the important bacterial
  functions in plant–bacteria and bacteria–bacteria interaction
  (Kramer et al., 2021); however, it has not been characterized well
  in Methylobacterium species and few strains in the genus have
  been reported to synthesize siderophores (Lacava et al., 2008).
  The recent ﬁnding of the aerobactin-like LCC gene cluster in
  strain AM1 showed that siderophores can play a critical role in
  Ln acquisition, which leads to the induction and activation of a
  novel enzyme, Ln-dependent XoxF-type MDHs. The mechanism
  for Ln-dependent expression switching (Ln-switch) between
  Ca2+-dependent MxaF and Ln-dependent XoxF is an important
  research topic in bacterial methylotrophy, and the elucidation of
  the siderophore function as lanthanophore is crucial to dissecting
  the molecular mechanism of Ln-switch.
  The genera Methylobacterium and Methylorubrum are diverse,
  comprising 63 species and categorized into three major clades,
  A, B, and C. Clade C has a diﬀerent methylotrophy gene
  repertoire, including a lack of mxaF in some strains, signifying
  the importance of the uptake of Ln in this group. This clade
  also has a diﬀerent set of genes for C1 compound metabolism,
  such as the glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase
  pathway (Yanpirat et al., 2020), and is characterized by a high GCrich genome (Alessa et al., 2021). Methylobacterium aquaticum
  strain 22A was isolated from Racomitrium japonicum (Tani et al.,
  2012). The strain belongs to clade C and its complete genome
  information is available (Tani et al., 2016). Strain 22A has plant
  growth promotion capability, although the mechanism has not
  yet been established. Siderophore is proposed to contribute to
  the plant growth promotion eﬀect. In this paper, we investigate
  the function of the staphyloferrin B-like siderophore from strain
  22A in plant growth promotion, bacterial physiology, and its
  involvement in methylotrophy. Furthermore, we aim to enhance
  knowledge on siderophore synthesis and receptors, using the
  genome information of all type strains of Methylobacterium and
  Methylorubrum species (Alessa et al., 2021).

  Methylobacterium aquaticum Lanthanophore/Siderophore
  S. aureus (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1)
  (Cheung et al., 2009) and Ralstonia solanacearum (Bhatt and
  Denny, 2004). The N- and C-terminal portions of SbnF of
  strain 22A showed 34 and 33% similarity to sbnE and sbnF
  of S. aureus, respectively, suggesting that sbnE and sbnF are
  fused in strain 22A. Similar gene clusters were also found in six
  other Methylobacterium type strains in a non-taxonomy-speciﬁc
  manner. We hypothesized that the strain 22A sbn cluster
  synthesizes a staphyloferrin B-like siderophore.
  Staphyloferrin B is biosynthesized by the SbnA-SbnI encoded
  by sbn gene cluster in Staphylococcus aureus (Cheung et al., 2009).
  SbnA, SbnB, and SbnG generate L-diaminopropionic acid (LDAP), α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), and citrate, respectively, as the
  siderophore precursors. SbnE condenses citrate and L-DAP to
  citryl-DAP. SbnF condenses citryl-1,2-diaminoethane (DAE) and
  L-DAP to L-DAP-citryl-DAE. SbnC catalyzes the amide linking
  of the precursor and α-KG to produce staphyloferrin B (Cheung
  et al., 2009). The sbn cluster is also proposed to synthesize a noncharacterized siderophore staphylobactin, which is larger than
  staphyloferrin A or B by >300 Da (Dale et al., 2004).
  Characterization of Siderophore Mutants
  of Strain 22A
  The
  spent
  medium
  of
  strain
  22A
  was
  negative
  for
  catecholate and hydroxamate siderophore tests but positive
  for
  hydroxycarboxylate-type
  siderophore
  (Supplementary
  Figure 2A). Knockout mutants for sbnC and sbnF that were
  annotated as iucA/iucC family siderophore biosynthesis proteins
  were constructed to generate 1sbnC, 1sbnF, and 1sbnCF.
  Gene disruptants were also generated for the other individual
  sbn genes and a hypothetical gene (Maq22A_c25465) at the
  distal end of the cluster. Strain 22A wild type showed a positive
  reaction on chrome azurol S (CAS) agar plate, which is indicative
  of siderophore production whereas 1sbnA, 1sbnD, 1sbnF,
  1sbnH, and 1sbnCF were negative (Supplementary Figure 2B).
  The strain 22A sbn gene cluster contains two of the three
  iucA/iucC family genes (sbnC and sbnF) involved in many
  general non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-independent
  siderophore (NIS) biosynthesis. NIS biosynthesis utilizes at least
  one of these enzymes for siderophore synthesis as a crucial
  component (Challis, 2005). Due to this important potential
  role, we used 1sbnCF as a representative siderophore mutant
  throughout this study.
  The 1sbnC showed a reduced CAS reaction and a normal
  growth, whereas 1sbnA, 1sbnD, 1sbnA, 1sbnD, and 1sbnCF
  showed slower growth compared to the wild type, on succinate in
  the presence of 100 µM FeSO4 (Figure 1A). The wild-type spent
  medium complemented the growth of 1sbnCF (Figure 1B),
  suggesting the inability of the siderophore synthesis of 1sbnCF.
  Interestingly, 1sbnCF was able to grow on succinate in the
  presence of iron citrate (>50 µM) (Figure 1C). Furthermore,
  the combined supplementation of FeSO4 (50 µM) and citrate
  rescued 1sbnCF in a citrate concentration-dependent manner
  (Figure 1D). These results suggested that although the sbn
  siderophore contributes to the utilization of FeSO4, strain 22A
  has another mechanism to acquire iron citrate.
  We cloned the promoter region of sbnA (PsbnA, 644 bp) into
  pAT06, a promoter-reporter vector containing bacterial luciferase
  genes as a reporter and introduced it into strain 22A wild type.
  PsbnA showed high activity with 5 µM FeSO4 and low activity
  with 100 µM FeSO4 or the presence of iron citrate (Figure 2).
  This result suggested that sbn expression is induced by low iron
  availability and repressed by iron citrate.
  Siderophore Mediates the Interaction
  With Plants
  Although strain 22A has been identiﬁed as a potential PGPB
  in ﬁeld and pot conditions (Tani et al., 2015), the growth
  promotion mechanism has not yet been studied. We assessed the
  contribution of siderophore to this plant–bacterial interaction.
  We used duckweed (Lemna gibba p8L) as a plant model.
  Strain 22A wild type and 1sbnCF were inoculated into 1/2
  Murashige–Skoog (MS) medium under two iron regimes. The
  wild type and 1sbnCF showed no plant growth promotion under
  suﬃcient iron conditions (10 mg/l) (Figures 3A,B). In ironlimited conditions (1 mg/l), the wild-type strain 22A promoted
  duckweed growth, whereas 1sbnCF suppressed the plant growth.
  These results suggested that the growth promotion eﬀect is
  dependent on iron availability, and the siderophore is directly
  involved in its mechanism.
  The
  treated
  plants
  were
  subjected
  to
  iron
  content
  measurement
  with
  inductively
  coupled
  plasma
  mass
  spectrometry (ICP-MS). The plants in suﬃcient iron conditions
  contained almost constant iron levels irrespective of the
  genotypes of strain 22A (Figure 3C), suggesting that there was
  no competition for iron between the plants and the bacteria.
  In iron-limited conditions where the plants showed relatively
  smaller biomass, the plant iron content was increased by the
  presence of the wild type, suggesting that strain 22A assisted in
  iron acquisition in the plants. In the presence of 1sbnCF, the
  plants contained lower iron compared to the treatment with the
  wild type, and the 1sbnCF cells contained more iron than the
  wild type. These results suggested that the mutant competed with
  the plant for iron. Meanwhile, the bacterial cell mass assessed as
  wet weight in these conditions showed no diﬀerence between the
  wild type and 1sbnCF (Figure 3D).
  The growth promotion eﬀect by the wild type was also
  reproduced in Arabidopsis thaliana, under low iron conditions
  (1 mg/l) (Supplementary Figure 3A), suggesting that the iron
  dependency of the growth promotion eﬀect is not dependent
  on plant species. A. thaliana was inoculated with a rifampicinresistant strain 22A (22A-rif) and a kanamycin-resistant 1sbnCF
  (1sbnCF-km) individually or in co-inoculation under 1 mg/l
  FeSO4 (Supplementary Figure 3B). 1sbnCF-km colonized the
  plant phyllosphere better than 22A-rif in both conditions.
  These results suggested that 1sbnCF could acquire iron in the
  A. thaliana phyllosphere without the siderophore.

  and Ln-Dependent Methylotrophy

  24 h and quantiﬁcation of soluble La. We could detect a 24-folds
  higher amount of La in the wild-type spent medium compared
  to the non-inoculated medium and 1sbnCF spent medium
  (Figure 4A), suggesting that sbn siderophore is involved in Ln
  solubilization and chelation. We also conﬁrmed that >50 µM
  citrate solubilized La2O3 (Figure 4B).
  1mxaF can grow on methanol only in the presence of La3+,
  due to intact XoxF (Masuda et al., 2018). 1mxaF containing the
  PsbnA reporter vector was cultivated on succinate plus methanol
  under various concentrations of LaCl3 and FeSO4. The promoter
  activity was the control level in LaCl3 concentration in the range
  of 0.3–30 µM under both 5 and 50 µM FeSO4 (Figure 4C).
  A high concentration of LaCl3 (90 µM) activated PsbnA under
  5 µM but not under 50 µM FeSO4, suggesting that LaCl3 created
  iron scarcity, increasing the need for siderophore synthesis.

  circles, cell yield (OD600). The results were presented as the
  average ± standard deviation (SD) (biological triplicates).
  To further examine the involvement of siderophore in Ln
  solubilization, we generated 1mxaF1sbnCF. The wild type grew
  on methanol utilizing FeSO4 or iron citrate and either forms
  of La (LaCl3 or La2O3) (Figure 4D). Without the addition of
  an iron source, the wild type could not grow, however, La
  source omission did not aﬀect its growth (data not shown).
  1mxaF growth on methanol was dependent on either of the La
  forms and iron. 1sbnCF and 1mxaF1sbnCF could not grow
  on methanol in all conditions, even under a high concentration
  of iron citrate (100 µM) that could complement their growth
  on succinate (Figure 1C). We also found that 1mxaF1sbnCF
  was able to grow on methanol in the presence of LaCl3 and
  the wild-type spent media (Figure 4E) or with citrate (but not
  iron citrate) in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4F).
  These results suggested that siderophore is not required for
  methylotrophic growth in the presence of citrate, but that it serves
  as an Ln chelator in the absence of citrate, and that citrate also
  chelates Ln for uptake.
  We assessed the promoter activity of MDH genes (xoxF and
  mxaF) in the wild type and 1sbnCF grown on methanol plus
  succinate in the absence/presence of 30 µM LaCl3. The wild type
  showed a clear Ln-dependent switch of MDH gene expression
  (Figure 4G). In the presence of LaCl3, 1sbnCF showed more than
  10 times higher activity of PxoxF than the wild type. Judging from
  the diﬀerence in ﬁnal 1sbnCF cell yield between 0 and 30 µM
  LaCl3, 1sbnCF has methanol oxidation capacity in the presence
  of LaCl3, which means that La3+ uptake occurs by an unknown
  mechanism to activate XoxF. The reason for the high activity of
  PxoxF is unclear, but it is possible that sbn siderophore is involved
  in the maintenance of La3+ concentration in the cells, and the
  resultant high La3+ content in the cells resulted in high induction
  of xoxF.
  Role of Sbn Siderophore in Bioﬁlm
  Formation, Resistance to Reactive
  Oxygen Species, and Heavy Metals

  with iron citrate resulted in bioﬁlm formation in a concentrationdependent manner in 1sbnCF (Supplementary Figure 4A).
  This result suggests that iron availability and siderophore
  production can inﬂuence bioﬁlm formation in strain 22A. We
  could not compare bioﬁlm formation without iron citrate since
  1sbnCF could not grow.
  1sbnCF was more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide (1 mM)
  and sodium nitrite (10 mM) but not to diamide (10 mM)
  compared to the wild type (Supplementary Figure 4B),
  suggesting that siderophore synthesis is involved in resistance to
  the oxidative stress.
  The growth of strain 22A and 1sbnCF in the presence
  of 50 µM iron citrate was not aﬀected by 10 µM ZnSO4,
  CuSO4, NiSO4, and MnSO4 (data not shown). The growth
  of 1sbnCF was inhibited by 100 µM ZnSO4, CuSO4, and
  NiSO4, but no signiﬁcant inhibition was seen on the wild-type
  strain (Figure 5A). Supplementation of wild-type spent media
  to 1sbnCF restored its growth under heavy metals. Higher iron
  concentration (100 µM iron citrate) also alleviated heavy metal
  toxicity in 1sbnCF. sbnA promoter activity in the wild type
  under 100 µM of each heavy metal and two iron concentration
  regimes was examined (Figure 5B). PsbnA showed a control-level
  activity under ZnSO4 and NiSO4, and repressed activity under
  CuSO4 and MnSO4 in the presence of 5 µM FeSO4. In the
  presence of 100 µM FeSO4, the promoter activity was generally
  repressed even in the presence of these metals, but not completely
  repressed in the presence of ZnSO4. The heavy metal content
  measurement revealed higher Zn accumulation and lower Ni
  accumulation in ZnSO4- and NiSO4-treated 1sbnCF compared
  to the wild type, respectively (Figure 5C). The cellular iron
  content in the absence of heavy metals was comparable between
  22A wild type and 1sbnCF when they were grown in the
  presence of iron citrate (Figure 5D). The addition of ZnSO4 or
  CuSO4 reduced, whereas the addition of MnSO4 increased, iron
  accumulation in both strains. The addition of NiSO4 resulted
  in iron accumulation that was similar to that of the control in
  both the wild type and 1sbnCF. Overall, these data suggested
  that sbn siderophore is involved in the heavy metal resistance of

  Variety of Siderophore Biosynthesis
  Clusters in Methylobacterium Species
  We found a total of 66 siderophore synthesis gene clusters
  among 60 genomes of Methylobacterium type strains and strain
  22A through anti-SMASH analysis (Supplementary Table 2).
  They had varied homology to known siderophore gene clusters
  (7–100%) and could be classiﬁed into 10 groups based on
  similarity. A total of 13 species were associated with two or
  more siderophore synthesis clusters. Most of the siderophore
  biosynthesis gene clusters were composed of 6–16 genes (data
  not shown). We found that 41 type strains were positive in
  the CAS agar assay. Although no gene cluster was identiﬁed in
  nine strains, seven of them were positive in the CAS agar assay.
  The malleobactin-like siderophore gene cluster was dominantly
  found in clades A, A1, and A5. The taiwachelin-like siderophore
  gene cluster was found in clade A4 and some members in clade B.
  Clades B2, C1, and C2 members have no dominant siderophore
  gene cluster, and only three species have a staphylobactin-like
  siderophore gene cluster in clade C1, to which M. aquaticum
  belongs. A total of 15 other siderophore gene clusters had
  no similarity to known clusters. Thus, siderophore synthesis
  is a common characteristic among Methylobacterium species,

  Co-inoculation of 58 Methylobacterium type strains with
  strain 22A 1sbnCF resulted in growth restoration by 21
  strains. Many of the positive strains have taiwachelin (8
  strains) or staphylobactin (6 strains), whereas strains containing
  malleobactin or ochrobactin were negative. Interestingly, only
  62% of the strains with taiwachelin-like siderophore could enable
  iron deﬁciency recovery. All ﬁve strains with an sbn cluster
  could complement the growth of 1sbnCF. R. solanacearum strain
  RS1000, which produces staphyloferrin B (Bhatt and Denny,
  2004), was also able to rescue 1sbnCF. The strains with an sbn
  cluster were all isolated from plants except for M. ajmalii strain
  IF7SW-B2T (Bijlani et al., 2021), implying the possible advantage
  of this type of siderophore in the plant-associated lifestyle.
  Characterization of TonB-Dependent
  Receptors in Strain 22A
  The strain 22A genome encodes 12 TBDRs, among which, those
  for iron-siderophore complex, iron citrate, and possible Lnlanthanophore should exist. We examined the phenotype of the
  gene disruption mutants or deletion mutants of these receptors in
  strain 22A. The 9 TBDR mutants not discussed here did not show
  any phenotypes in these assays.
  TonB-dependent receptor for sbn siderophore: A TBDR gene
  (Maq22A_c25420) was found in the upstream region of the sbn
  gene cluster and named tonB_sbn. 1tonB_sbn showed slower
  growth with FeSO4, and 1sbnCF1tonB_sbn could not grow on
  succinate with FeSO4 and wild-type spent medium (Figure 6A).
  Iron citrate supplementation rescued 1sbnCF1tonB_sbn growth
  (Figure 6B). These results indicated that tonB_sbn is involved in
  the sbn-siderophore-iron complex transport.
  TonB-dependent receptor for iron citrate: We found that
  a gene deletion mutant of Maq22A_c24885, herein named
  1tonB_cit, under a background of 1sbnCF, showed a lag
  phase when grown on succinate with iron citrate (Figure 6B).
  Supplementation of 50 µM citrate and 50 µM FeSO4 also resulted
  in a lag phase (Figure 6C). tonB_cit is therefore involved in iron
  citrate transport. However, the mutant could still grow. There
  may thus be another TBDR that can transport iron citrate or one
  for iron chelated by other substances.

  three replicates ± standard deviation (SD).
  background did not grow on methanol with LaCl3 (Figure 6D).
  The promoter region of tonB_Ln was cloned into pAT06, and
  the promoter activity in the wild type showed lower expression
  in a higher LaCl3 concentration (Figure 6E). This suggests
  that tonB_Ln is involved in Ln transport, and its expression is
  repressed when Ln is well available.
  Variety and Distribution of
  TonB-Dependent Receptors in
  Methylobacterium Genomes
  Using the sequences of the TBDRs in strain 22A and the TBDRs
  found in M. extorquens strain AM1 (LutH, META1p1785,
  and
  TonB_Lcc,
  META1p4129)
  as
  queries,
  we
  searched
  TBDRs encoded in all type strains of Methylobacterium and
  Methylorubrum species (Figure 7 and Supplementary Table 3).
  TBDRs found in the genera were phylogenetically classiﬁed into
  25 clusters, and each strain had 7–23 TBDRs in its genome.
  TonB_sbn is homologous to TonB_Lcc of strain AM1 and 52
  other TBDRs. TonB_Ln is phylogenetically close to strain AM1
  LutH and widely conserved with a total of 69 homologs in
  the genera; it is especially enriched in clades A4 and C1. LutH
  has only 10 homologs and is well conserved only in clade B
  (Methylorubrum species) and two clade A1 members. TonB_cit
  was also well conserved (40 homologous TBDRs), suggesting that
  the majority of Methylobacterium species can utilize iron citrate.
  TBDRs in strain 22A are phylogenetically diverse and each of
  them is widely conserved among Methylobacterium species.
  DISCUSSION
  The strain 22A sbn gene cluster showed 33–56% homology to
  sbn genes in S. aureus (Supplementary Table 1). The cluster
  lacks sbnI, whereas sbnE and sbnF are fused in strain 22A. We
  presumed that strain 22A siderophore has a similar structure to
  staphyloferrin B. 1sbnA, 1sbnD, 1sbnF, 1sbnH, and 1sbnCF
  but not 1sbnC showed defective growth on succinate under
  iron deﬁciency. Because SbnC catalyzes the critical ﬁnal step for
  staphyloferrin B synthesis, the intermediate(s) produced without
  SbnC may still be active for iron chelation. SbnF in strain 22A
  (the fused SbnE and SbnF) may be more important to synthesize
  the intermediates. This point will be clariﬁed when we determine
  the siderophore structure and the functions of each gene.
  1sbnCF could not grow well with FeSO4 (Figure 1A), and
  its growth was complemented by the spent medium of the
  wild type or iron citrate (Figures 1B,C). sbn gene expression is
  induced by low iron availability and repressed by iron citrate
  (Figure 2). Citrate has a lower aﬃnity (Kd < 0.260 nM) for iron

  FIGURE 7 | Phylogenetic tree and gene counts of TBDRs found in the genomes of different subclades of Methylobacterium type strains. The phylogenetic tree is
  constructed based on the amino acid sequences of TBDR genes. The Methylobacterium subclade deﬁnition is based on our previous report (Alessa et al., 2021).
  A total of 25 clades are labeled A-Y. The counts of TBDRs and description of characterized TBDRs are indicated in brackets. Details are presented in

  than that of conventional siderophores (Fukushima et al., 2012)
  and acts as a general iron chelator for the bacterial community
  as opposed to individual siderophores (Mazoy et al., 1997).
  Therefore, strain 22A preferably utilizes iron citrate if available,
  without synthesizing sbn siderophore.
  The sbn siderophore of strain 22A is one of the plant
  growth promotion factors (Figure 3). Bacterial siderophore
  supplementation abolishes iron deﬁciency in plants (Crowley
  et al., 1992). Interestingly, 1sbnCF competed with plants for iron,
  which resulted in a low plant iron uptake. Because strain 22A
  can also utilize citrate as a carbon source, and citrate is one of
  the common organic acids in root exudates in response to iron
  deﬁciency (Ling et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 2015), we considered that
  1sbnCF overtook the iron complexed by plant-derived citrate.
  It should be noted that since iron citrate represses siderophore
  production, siderophore synthesis in the wild type precedes the
  plant citrate exudation, and the wild-type strain 22A did not
  become opportunistic. The growth promotion ability of strain
  22A was also observed in A. thaliana in low iron conditions
  (Supplementary Figure 3). The siderophore was not essential
  for strain 22A to colonize the A. thaliana phyllosphere, but in
  return, the plant growth was repressed. Judging from its iron
  accumulation, 1sbnCF can pirate iron citrate that is relatively
  abundant in the phyllosphere (Yokosho et al., 2009; RellánÁlvarez et al., 2010). On the other hand, siderophore synthesis
  was a biological cost in the wild type.
  We found that the sbn siderophore and citrate solubilize
  La2O3 (Figures 4A,B). The sbn siderophore was indispensable in
  the absence of citrate (Figures 4D,E) but was dispensable in the
  presence of citrate (not iron citrate) for XoxF- and Ln-dependent
  methylotrophic growth (Figure 4F). Thus, we concluded that
  the sbn siderophore is another type of “lanthanophore” involved
  in Ln uptake, in addition to the aerobactin-type siderophore in
  M. extorquens strain AM1 (Zytnick et al., 2022). Interestingly,
  sbn siderophore inactivation resulted in the overactivation of
  PxoxF in the presence of LaCl3 (Figure 4G). The expression of
  xoxF and mxaF is regulated by the Ln-switch; therefore, this xoxF
  overexpression indeed suppressed mxaF. It is generally accepted
  that siderophores play a role in the homeostasis of other metals
  other than iron. Most probably, the sbn siderophore plays a role

  not only in controlled Ln uptake but also in maintaining cellular
  Ln homeostasis. The siderophore-free La3+ in the periplasm
  might strongly induce XoxF through activation of MxbDM
  that is a two-component signaling system responsible for the
  expression of MDHs (Yanpirat et al., 2020). The exact reason
  for this high xoxF induction remains to be determined through
  investigation of the Ln-switch; however, here, we can add the sbntype lanthanophore as one of the factors involved in the complex
  switching mechanism.
  Iron concentration inversely impacted the bioﬁlm formation
  in strain 22A wild type. Access to a suﬃcient amount of
  iron could deter bioﬁlm formation since environmental stresses
  such as iron starvation generally trigger bioﬁlm formation
  (Muhammad et al., 2020). This corroborated with other studies
  showing that iron depletion enhanced bioﬁlm formation in
  diﬀerent bacteria including E. coli (Hancock et al., 2008)
  and Cupriavidus necator (Li et al., 2019). In contrast, bioﬁlm
  formation in 1sbnCF was enhanced with an increasing iron
  concentration (Supplementary Figure 4A). Iron is essential for
  bioﬁlm formation (Oliveira et al., 2017) and iron is a limiting
  growth factor for 1sbnCF at the tested iron citrate concentrations
  (Supplementary Figure 4A). The enhanced bioﬁlm formation
  in 1sbnCF by iron citrate suggested that iron acquisition rather
  than sbn siderophore per se was the important determinant.
  1sbnCF showed less tolerance to hydrogen peroxide and
  sodium nitrite (Supplementary Figure 4B), implying that this
  iron uptake system confers tolerance to oxidative stress. Iron
  is a dangerous metal due to its capacity to generate reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) through the Fenton reaction (Corpas
  et al., 2015). Therefore, iron homeostasis could be related to
  oxidative stress (Cornelis et al., 2011). SirA, a staphyloferrin
  B transport system, inﬂuences tolerance to ROS in S. aureus
  (Nobre and Saraiva, 2014). Whereas hydrogen peroxide increases
  intracellular hydroxyl radicals that lead to direct oxidation,
  diamide causes indirect oxidative stress by oxidizing glutathione
  (GSH) and furthering redox imbalance (Toledano et al., 2003).
  Therefore, iron mitigation by sbn siderophore could be ineﬀective
  for such an indirect oxidative stress mechanism.
  The sbn siderophore of strain 22A contributes to heavy metal
  resistance, and the results of the cellular metal accumulation and
  PsbnA activity analyses indicated that toxicity and siderophoremediated resistance mechanisms diﬀer depending on the metal
  species (Figure 5). The heavy metal toxicity was also inﬂuenced
  by the iron concentration. This suggested possibility of uptake
  competition among the metals. ZnSO4 treatment did not have an
  eﬀect on PsbnA activity, caused a high accumulation of Zn2+ in
  1sbnCF, and caused iron scarcity. The scarcity suggested that the
  sbn siderophore binds Zn2+, and hence, the siderophore prevents
  uncontrolled entry of Zn2+ into the cells (Braud et al., 2009).
  CuSO4 treatment repressed PsbnA activity, caused unchanged
  Cu2+ accumulation in the wild type and 1sbnCF, and decreased
  iron content in the wild type. Therefore, copper susceptibility of
  the mutant may include iron scarcity caused by PsbnA repression
  but not Cu2+ accumulation. NiSO4 treatment did not have an
  eﬀect on PsbnA activity and caused a higher accumulation of Ni2+
  in the wild type. Thus, Ni susceptibility of the mutant was not
  caused by Ni accumulation but rather by repressed iron transport
  that is necessary to overcome Ni toxicity. MnSO4 treatment at
  the tested concentration did not cause any growth inhibition in
  the wild type and 1sbnCF, suggesting that the sbn siderophore
  does not take part in the resistance. However, it caused decreased
  PsbnA activity, higher Mn, and iron accumulation in both cells.
  This contradictory decreased PsbnA activity and higher iron
  accumulation could not be explained well only with these
  data. These metals are essential mineral elements that exhibit
  important interactions and possible competitive inhibition of
  transport. The biochemical resistance mechanism in which the
  sbn siderophore participates awaits further characterization of
  the puriﬁed siderophore including its binding capacity and
  identiﬁcation of the transporters for each metal.
  Siderophore production is a common characteristic in
  Methylobacterium
  species
  bearing
  similarity
  and
  disparity
  among groups of individual strains (Supplementary Table 2).
  Malleobactin- and taiwachelin-type siderophore gene clusters
  may have been conserved through their evolution and phylogeny
  whereas the horizontal acquisition of the other siderophore gene
  clusters is dependent on their habitat as opposed to species
  evolution. Other strains of Methylobacterium species, as well
  as R. solanacearum with sbn genes and many taiwachelincontaining strains, were able to rescue 1sbnCF from iron
  starvation. Thus, strain 22A can utilize these xenosiderophores
  from Methylobacterium species and other non-methylotrophic
  bacteria. The diﬀerent types of siderophores and inter-species
  utilization among Methylobacterium species may contribute to
  the speciﬁc species predominance of the genus or even to
  shape the microbial community in diﬀerent niches, especially
  when Methylobacterium comprises one of the most predominant
  species in an environment, such as the phyllosphere.
  Among 12 TBDRs in strain 22A, here, we identiﬁed two
  TBDRs for iron uptake (Figure 6), which may enable the
  strain to more eﬃciently acquire either siderophore-bound or
  citrate-bound iron. The tonB_sbn is used for the uptake of sbn
  siderophore. On the other hand, tonB_cit is more eﬃcient in iron
  citrate uptake; however, another TBDR for iron citrate has not
  yet been identiﬁed. The tonB_Ln is necessary for Ln-dependent
  methylotrophy (Figure 6D). The expression of tonB_Ln was
  repressed with increased Ln concentration (Figure 6E). It
  remains unknown what form of Ln3+ is the substrate for
  tonB_Ln (sbn siderophore-bound Ln3+ or citrate-Ln3+) and
  whether tonB_sbn incorporates sbn siderophore-bound Ln3+
  or not. The Ln3+
  concentration-dependent repression of
  tonB_Ln, which was also found in tonB_LutH in strain AM1
  (Roszczenko-Jasi´nska et al., 2020), suggested that they have
  an Ln3+-sensing mechanism to optimize Ln3+ uptake through
  TBDR regulation.
  TonB_sbn, which is homologous to tonB_Lcc in strain
  AM1, was widely conserved among Methylobacterium species
  (Figure 7). The tonB_Ln and tonB_cit were also well conserved.
  Interestingly, tonB_LutH in strain AM1 was less conserved and
  found only in clade B (Methylorubrum species). The distribution
  of common or clade speciﬁc TBDRs may suggest the possibility
  of chelator sharing or competition among the Methylobacterium
  species. Other non-characterized TBDRs of strain 22A also
  showed a wide range of conservation within Methylobacterium

  ionophore will be intriguing.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS
  Microbial Strains and Culture Conditions
  The Methylobacterium species used in this study were grown and
  maintained on an R2A medium or mineral medium containing
  either 0.5% methanol or 0.5% succinate (herein referred to as
  methanol and succinate media), as previously described (Alessa
  et al., 2021). Kanamycin (25 mg/l), rifampicin (20 mg/l), LaCl3
  (30 µM), La2O3 (9 mg/l), FeSO4 (5–100 µM), and iron citrate (5
  or 100 µM) were added when necessary.
  The growth tests were conducted in 200 µl various medium
  prepared in 96-well plates, rotary-shaken at 300 rpm at 28◦C.
  The strains grown on R2A solid media supplemented with iron
  citrate were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 0.9%
  NaCl solution to make a cell suspension (OD600 = 1.0). The cell
  suspension was inoculated to a ﬁnal OD value of 0.02 in the test
  media condition. Growth was monitored by measuring OD600
  using a microplate reader (PowerScan HT, Sumitomo Dainippon
  Pharma, Osaka, Japan).
  The wild type strain 22A was grown in methanol media
  supplemented with 5 µM FeSO4 for 5 days. The cells were
  precipitated at 10,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant was
  ﬁltered using a 0.2-µm membrane ﬁlter. The spent media was
  stored at –20◦C until use. The target strains were grown on 10%
  wild-type spent media in the appropriate media.
  Detection of Siderophore
  Siderophore synthesis was assessed by chrome azurol S (CAS)
  agar assay for all the strains grown in modiﬁed succinate media.
  In brief, succinate media without Fe3+ was mixed with CAS as
  previously described (Louden et al., 2011). Diﬀerent methods
  were used to assess the types of siderophores. Arnow assay
  for catechol-type (Arnow, 1937): 50 µl of culture supernatant,
  50 µl of 0.5 M HCl, and 10 µl reagent (1 g/ml NaNO2 and
  1 g/ml Na2MoO4·2H2O) were mixed. After the formation of
  the yellow color, 90 µl of 0.1 M NaOH was added, resulting in
  the generation of red color. 1,2-dihydroxybenzene was used as a
  standard. Atkin assay for hydroxamate-type (Atkin et al., 1970):
  50 µl of culture supernatant was added to 50 µl of the Atkin
  reagent [0.177 g of Fe(ClO4)3 and 1.43 g HClO4 in 100 ml water].
  After 5 min at room temperature, the appearance of a winered color indicated the presence of hydroxamate siderophore.
  Salicylhydroxamic acid was used as a standard. Vogel test for
  hydroxycarboxylate (Vogel, 1957): the reagent was made by
  adding 20 µl of phenolphthalein to 60 µl of 1 M NaOH and
  topping up to 1 ml with water. In total, 50 µl of culture
  supernatant was mixed with 50 µl of reagent. The disappearance
  of color by the addition of culture supernatant indicated the
  presence of hydroxycarboxylate siderophore.
  Construction of Mutant Strains
  The
  primers
  used
  in
  this
  study
  are
  listed
  in
  Supplementary
  Table

  We
  generated
  gene
  deletion
  mutants of strain 22A siderophore synthesis gene cluster,
  1sbnC
  (Maq22A_c25435),
  1sbnF
  (Maq22A_c25445),
  and
  1sbnCF. Similarly, TBDR gene deletion mutants, tonB_cit
  (Maq22A_c24885) and tonB_Ln (Maq22A_c14845), were also
  generated in this study. These gene deletion mutants were
  generated using the allele-replacement vector pK18mobSacB,
  as previously described. Gene disruption mutants of other sbn
  genes (sbnA, sbnB, sbnD, sbnG, sbnH, and Maq22A_c25465) and
  TBDR genes (tonB_sbn (Maq22A_c25420), Maq22A_c06025,
  Maq22A_c08030,
  Maq22A_c21870,
  Maq22A_c22745,
  Maq22A_c22905,
  Maq22A_c27600,
  Maq22A_1p31685,
  Maq22A_1p34825, and Maq22A_1p38180) were also generated
  using pK18mobSacB. In brief, the approximately 600 bp midportion of the target gene was polymerase chain reaction
  (PCR)-ampliﬁed and cloned into the EcoRI site on the
  pK18mobSacB
  vector.
  The
  vectors
  were
  introduced
  into
  strain 22A via conjugation using Escherichia coli S17-1, and
  the kanamycin-resistant mutants were regarded as the gene
  disruption mutants. 1mxaF was generated in our previous study
  (Masuda et al., 2018).
  Construction of Promoter-Reporter
  Vector
  We developed pCM130KmC for general cloning purposes that
  operates in strain 22A from pCM130 (Addgene plasmid #45828,
  Marx and Lidstrom, 2001) in our previous study (Yanpirat et al.,
  2020). A fragment containing an EcoRI site and His-tag coding
  sequence generated by a pair of complementary oligonucleotides
  (pCM130KmCinsert1 and 2, Supplementary Table 3) was
  inserted into the EcoRI site of pCM130KmC with an In-Fusion
  Cloning kit to generate pAT01. Next, we also introduced bacterial
  luciferase (Lux) genes that are PCR-ampliﬁed from pUC18-miniTn7T-Gm-lux (Wehrmann et al., 2017) with LuxC-F and LuxER2 primers into pAT01 to construct a luciferase-reporter vector
  (pAT06-Lux). The PCR-generated promoter regions of sbnA,
  tonB_Ln, xoxF, and mxaF were cloned into the NcoI site on the
  pAT06-Lux vector. The vectors were introduced into strain 22A
  via conjugation using E. coli S17-1 and selected on kanamycin.
  To assess the promoter activity, cells of strain 22A and
  its derivatives transformed with pAT06-Lux containing an
  appropriate promoter were maintained on R2A supplemented
  with 25 mg/l Km. The cells were collected, washed with
  0.9% NaCl solution, and inoculated into appropriate media
  (succinate or methanol or methanol/succinate medium) at a
  ﬁnal concentration of OD600 = 0.02. The culture was replicated
  in white 96-well plates (for luminescence measurement) and
  transparent 96-well plates for bacteria growth assessment. The
  growth conditions were maintained as mentioned above. The
  maximum luminescence was normalized to cell density (OD600)
  and reported as promoter activity.

  Methylobacterium aquaticum Lanthanophore/Siderophore
  (1) Lanthanum uptake. Strain 22A wild type and 1sbnCF
  were grown on succinate-methanol media for 5 days, and their
  spent media was ﬁltered using a 0.2-µm membrane ﬁlter. The
  spent media or varied concentrations of citrate were incubated
  with La2O3 18 mg/l for 24 h at 28◦C under shaking at 300 rpm.
  The sample was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 min, at 25◦C) to
  remove La2O3, and 300 µl of the supernatant was dried at 80◦C
  overnight. The dry weight was measured, and the pellets were
  resuspended in 70% HNO3 and boiled at 100◦C for 1 h. Samples
  were diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 5% HNO3 and analyzed
  by ICP-MS (Agilent 7500cx). Strain 22A wild type, 1sbnCF,
  and 1mxaF1sbnCF were grown in 200 µl methanol medium
  containing La2O3/LaCl3 and iron citrate in 96-well plates. The
  plates were shaken at 28◦C at 300 rpm and the cell growth was
  monitored (OD600) using a microplate reader.
  (2) Oxidative and nitrosative stress resistance. Strain 22A
  wild type and 1sbnCF were inoculated in liquid R2A media
  containing 1 mM hydrogen peroxide, 10 mM sodium nitrite, or
  10 mM diamide and were incubated at 28◦C with continuous
  shaking at 300 rpm for 24 h in liquid R2A media. The samples
  were serial diluted and spread on solid R2A media containing
  100 µM iron citrate for 48 h. The colony-forming units (CFUs)
  per milliliter were evaluated, and the percentage of survival in
  comparison with the unchallenged treatment was calculated.
  (3) Heavy metal tolerance. Strain 22A wild type and 1sbnCF
  were grown in succinate media containing 100 µM of each
  heavy metal in 96-well plates and their growth was monitored
  by measuring OD600. For cellular metal content quantiﬁcation,
  they were grown on succinate in the presence of 25 µM
  of ZnSO4, CuSO4, NiSO4, and MnSO4 for 5 days. The cells
  were harvested and washed three times with phosphate-buﬀered
  saline (PBS) containing 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
  (EDTA) and then six times with PBS. Bacterial pellets were
  desiccated at 100◦C overnight. Thereafter, the samples were
  digested and analyzed with the ICP-MS as described above.
  Iron concentration-dependent heavy metal toxicity was also
  determined by culturing strain 22A and 1sbnCF in a varied
  concentration of iron and the heavy metals (50–100 µM).
  (4) Bioﬁlm assay. Bioﬁlm formation was studied by a modiﬁed
  method by O’Toole (2011). Strain 22A wild type and 1sbnCF
  were cultured in succinate media containing 25 to 100 µM
  FeSO4 and iron citrate prepared in 96-well plates at 28◦C for
  96 h. The content of each well was removed by decantation.
  The wells were then washed three times with PBS (pH 7.3),
  air-dried for 45 min, and stained with 0.1% w/v crystal violet
  solution (200 µl) for 10 min. After three times washing with
  water, 200 µl of 95% ethanol was added, and the absorbance was
  determined at 595 nm.
  Interaction of Strain 22A and Plants
  (1) Plant growth promotion by strain 22A: Single sterilized
  duckweed frond was grown in liquid (5 ml) half-strength
  Murashige and Skoog medium (1/2 MS) under a modiﬁed FeSO4
  concentration of 1 or 10 mg/l. The plants were subjected to
  inoculation of strain 22A wild type and 1sbnCF at a ﬁnal
  concentration of OD600 = 0.01 under aseptic conditions. Surface
  sterilized A. thaliana Col-0 seeds were grown on solid 1/2 MS
  and inoculated with the bacteria as described above. The plants
  were grown at 23◦C with a photoperiod of 16/8 h (light/dark).
  The experiments were conducted in triplicate. After 28 days, the
  plants were transferred into separate 1.5-ml tubes and bacterial
  cells in the media were pelleted at 4,000 × g for 4 min. The plant
  and bacterial cell fresh weight, dry weight, and metal contents
  were determined.
  (2) In planta colonization assay: A rifampicin-resistant
  spontaneous
  mutant
  of
  strain
  22A
  (strain
  22A-rif)
  and
  kanamycin-resistant 1sbnCF (1sbnCF-km) were generated as
  previously described (Alamgir et al., 2015). A. thaliana seeds were
  inoculated with the 5 µl (OD600 = 0.01) of the two strains singly
  or in combination and grown as described previously. A total of
  four seedlings were used for each experiment and replicated three
  times. Then, 5–10 leaves of A. thaliana plants not touching the
  media (200–300 mg fresh weight) were washed in 1.5-ml sterile
  tubes containing 1 ml 0.9% NaCl. Bacteria were dislodged from
  the leaf by shaking (5,000 rpm, 10 min) and sonication (34%
  amplitude, 20 s, Vibra cell, Sonics and Materials Inc.) followed by
  vortexing for 30 s. The resulting suspensions were serially diluted
  and plated onto R2A containing rifampicin or kanamycin for
  CFU determination.
  Characterization of TonB-Dependent
  Receptor in Strain 22A
  A total of 12 TBDRs in strain 22A were assessed for their
  role in iron-sbn siderophore uptake in 96-well plates. The
  mutant strains of the 12 TBDR in wild-type backgrounds were
  grown in succinate media supplemented with 100 µM FeSO4.
  Similarly, the mutants generated under 1sbnCF background
  were cultivated in succinate media supplemented with 50 µM
  FeSO4 and 10% wild-type spent media, or 100 µM iron citrate,
  or 50 µM FeSO4 and 50 µM citrate. The mutant strains of the 12
  TBDR with a background of 1mxaF were also generated to assess
  the TBDR for Ln uptake.
  Analysis of Siderophore Biosynthesis
  Clusters and TonB-Dependent Receptors
  in Methylobacterium Species
  A search for secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes was
  performed for the 60 Methylobacterium species genome to
  predict the siderophore gene cluster using AntiSMASH software

  Abstract
  This review covers some recent advances in application of omics
  technologies to studying methylotrophs, with special reference to
  their activities in natural environments. Some of the developments
  highlighted in this review are the new outlook at the role of the
  XoxF-type, lanthanum-dependent methanol dehydrogenase in
  natural habitats, new mechanistic details of methane oxidation
  through the reverse methanogenesis pathway, propensity of
  'aerobic' methanotrophs to thrive in hypoxic environments and
  potential connection of this process to denitrification, and a novel
  outlook at methane oxidation as a community function.
