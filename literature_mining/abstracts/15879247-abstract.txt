Naxibacter alkalitolerans gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel member of the family 'Oxalobacteraceae' isolated from China.

A taxonomic study was performed on strain YIM 31775(T), which was isolated from a soil sample collected from Yunnan Province, China. The isolate was chemo-organotrophic, aerobic and Gram-negative. Cells were short rods and motile, with one or more polar flagella. Growth temperature and pH ranged from 4 to 55 degrees C and 6.5 to 12.0, respectively; the optimum growth temperature and pH were 28-37 degrees C and 7.0-9.0, respectively. Q-8 was the predominant respiratory lipoquinone. The major fatty acids were C(16 : 1)omega7c (42.4 %) and C(16 : 0) (28.1 %). The DNA G + C content was 62.4 +/ -0.3 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain YIM 31775(T) should be placed within the family 'Oxalobacteraceae', in which it formed a distinct lineage. Based on the high 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence and phenotypic characteristics, it is proposed that strain YIM 31775(T) should be classified as representing a novel member of the family 'Oxalobacteraceae', for which the name Naxibacter alkalitolerans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YIM 31775(T) (= CCTCC AA 204003(T) = KCTC 12194(T)).
