Abstract
Methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) catalyzes the first step in methanol
use by methylotrophic bacteria and the second step in methane
conversion by methanotrophs. Gram-negative bacteria possess an
MDH with pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as its catalytic center.
This MDH belongs to the broad class of eight-bladed β propeller
quinoproteins, which comprise a range of other alcohol and
aldehyde dehydrogenases. A well-investigated MDH is the
heterotetrameric MxaFI-MDH, which is composed of two large
catalytic subunits (MxaF) and two small subunits (MxaI). MxaFIMDHs bind calcium as a cofactor that assists PQQ in catalysis.
Genomic analyses indicated the existence of another MDH distantly
related to the MxaFI-MDHs. Recently, several of these so-called
XoxF-MDHs have been isolated. XoxF-MDHs described thus far are
homodimeric proteins lacking the small subunit and possess a rareearth element (REE) instead of calcium. The presence of such REE
may confer XoxF-MDHs a superior catalytic efficiency. Moreover,
XoxF-MDHs are able to oxidize methanol to formate, rather than to
formaldehyde as MxaFI-MDHs do. While structures of MxaFI- and
XoxF-MDH are conserved, also regarding the binding of PQQ, the
accommodation of a REE requires the presence of a specific

aspartate residue near the catalytic site. XoxF-MDHs containing
such REE-binding motif are abundantly present in genomes of
methylotrophic and methanotrophic microorganisms and also in
organisms that hitherto are not known for such lifestyle. Moreover,
sequence analyses suggest that XoxF-MDHs represent only a small
part of putative REE-containing quinoproteins, together covering an
unexploited potential of metabolic functions.
