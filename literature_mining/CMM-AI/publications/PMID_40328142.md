Abstract

## Page 8

The mechanism by which pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-
dependent methanol dehydrogenases (MDH), bearing either a Ca2+
or a lanthanide (Ln3+) ion in their active site, oxidize methanol has
been intensely debated. In particular, the Ln3+-dependent activity
of Ln-MDH remains poorly understood. The lack of experimental
evidence represents a significant limitation to improve our
understanding of these enzymes. In this work, we propose that
insights on Ca- and Ln-MDH reactivity can be gained by examining
a model reaction, the hydration of PQQ. Indeed, this reaction is
similar to the first step of the putative methanol additionelimination mechanism and is expected to be similarly influenced
by the metal ion. The apparent affinity constants of PQQ for Ca2+
and Ln3+ were determined by UVvis absorption spectroscopy. LnPQQ complexes in aqueous solution were analyzed by steady-state
and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The thermodynamic
and kinetic parameters describing the equilibrium were obtained by
variable-temperature and proton exchange spectroscopy (EXSY)
NMR, as well as DFT calculations. Results demonstrated a Lndependent exchange rate for PQQ hydration equilibrium, the late
and more Lewis acidic Ln3+ having the stronger impact.
Keywords: Exchange rate constant; Hydration reaction; Lanthanide
complexes; Methanol dehydrogenases; Pyrroloquinoline quinone.
