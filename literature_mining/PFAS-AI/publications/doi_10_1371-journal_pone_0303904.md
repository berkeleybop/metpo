Abstract
Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a prominent perfluorinated
compound commonly found in the environment, known to pose
various risks to human health. However, the removal of PFOS
presents significant challenges, primarily due to the limited
discovery of bacteria capable of effectively degrading PFOS.
Moreover, single degradation bacteria often encounter obstacles in
individual cultivation and the breakdown of complex pollutants. In
contrast, microbial consortia have shown promise in pollutant
degradation. This study employed a continuous enrichment method,
combined with multiple co-metabolic substrates, to investigate a
microbial consortium with the potential for PFOS degradation. By
employing this methodology, we effectively identified a microbial
consortium that demonstrated the capacity to reduce PFOS when
exposed to an optimal concentration of methanol. The consortium
predominantly comprised of Hyphomicrobium species (46.7%)
along with unclassified microorganisms (53.0%). Over a duration of
20 days, the PFOS concentration exhibited a notable decrease of
56.7% in comparison to the initial level, while considering the
exclusion of adsorption effects. Furthermore, by comparing the
predicted metabolic pathways of the microbial consortium with the
genome of a known chloromethane-degrading bacterium,
Hyphomicrobium sp. MC1, using the KEGG database, we observed
distinct variations in the metabolic pathways, suggesting the
potential role of the unclassified microorganisms. These findings
underscore the potential effectiveness of a "top-down" functional
microbial screening approach in the degradation of stubborn

1. Introduction
Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) are a class of compounds where
all hydrogen atoms in hydrocarbon compounds and their

## Page 7

derivatives are replaced by fluorine atoms [1–3]. Among these
compounds, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a common example
found in the environment and serves as the ultimate transformation
product of numerous other PFCs [4–7]. PFOS poses various risks to
biological health, and studies have linked it to the incidence of
human bladder cancer [8]. Additionally, PFOS has been detected in
animals, human blood, dust, and water bodies [9–11].
Despite the significant risks associated with PFOS, its removal
remains a challenging task [12–14]. Common methods used for
PFOS removal include physical separation and chemical
degradation, both of which are expensive and complex [15,16].
Bioremediation, a simple and cost-effective remediation method,
has been employed for the treatment of various pollutants.
However, the bioavailability of PFOS is severely limited due to
factors such as the high bond energy of C-F bonds within PFOS and
the protective shell formed by fluorine atoms [17]. As a result, only
a few PFOS-degrading bacteria have been reported thus far. For
instance, Huang and Jaffe [18] discovered Acidimicrobium sp. A6,
which is capable of partially degrading PFOS under anaerobic
conditions.
However, the degradation of pollutants by individual species
presents a range of challenges in the field. Current research suggests
that a single species may lack certain genes or enzymes in their
metabolic pathways, leading to the accumulation of toxic
byproducts and incomplete degradation of pollutants [19].
Moreover, individual species are vulnerable to environmental
disturbances that may impact their functional capabilities [20].
Despite the discovery of numerous bacteria with degradation
capabilities, many of them remain uncultivable. Molecular biology
analyses have revealed unexplored functionalities in these
uncultured microorganisms. Mei et al. [21] demonstrated the
crucial role of an uncultivated bacterium in amino acid degradation
through transcriptomic and metagenomic analyses. There are
several reasons for the uncultivability of microorganisms, including
microbial interactions. Some microorganisms engaged in symbiotic

## Page 8

relationships are unable to survive independently when separated
from other members [22]. All of these factors impose limitations on
the utilization of microbial resources.
Synthetic microbial consortia pertain to microbial communities
consisting of two or more genetically modified cell populations or
artificially constructed community systems achieved by cocultivating multiple species under controlled environmental
conditions [23,24]. Unlike single species, which encounter
numerous obstacles, synthetic microbial consortia aim to mimic
natural microbial communities. Notably, synthetic microbial
consortia have exhibited enhanced efficiency in degrading specific
substances when compared to individual species [25]. For example,
Rodríguez-Castillo et al. [26] successfully enriched a nicotinedegrading consortium from agricultural soil, consisting of eight
bacterial strains and one yeast strain, which collectively degraded
approximately 95.8% and 94.4% of distinct nicotine combinations.
Additionally, for recalcitrant or high-concentration pollutants, the
addition of auxiliary substances such as simple carbon sources can
stimulate degradation. These substances provide nutrients, enhance
pollutant bioavailability, and accelerate microbial degradation
processes [27]. Synthetic microbial consortia can uncover
additional microbial functionalities, offering innovative strategies
for the biodegradation of recalcitrant pollutants [28–31]. Previous
studies have provided evidence of researchers reporting their
findings across diverse scientific disciplines in order to advance
knowledge. Within these scientific reports, particular attention has
been directed by many researchers towards fields associated with
medicine, bacteria, and pollution absorption [32–35].
Despite persistent efforts, the biodegradation of PFOS remains a
significant challenge due to its recalcitrant nature and the limited
discovery of effective PFOS-degrading bacteria. Moreover, relying
solely on individual bacterial species for PFOS degradation presents
drawbacks, including incomplete degradation due to missing genes
or enzymes and instability in the face of environmental
disturbances. While synthetic microbial consortia hold promise for

## Page 9

pollutant degradation by mimicking natural microbial communities,
research on their application to PFOS degradation is limited.
Therefore, the objective of this study was to employ a "top-down"
functional screening approach using synthetic microbial consortia
to identify novel capabilities for PFOS degradation. Soil samples
contaminated with PFOS over a long period were subjected to
extended enrichment and acclimatization in the laboratory under
various conditions, including the presence of auxiliary substrates
and PFOS stress. The objective of this study was to investigate and
resolve lingering inquiries regarding the degradation capabilities of
microbial consortia towards persistent pollutants like PFOS. By
identifying the microbial community structures that displayed PFOS
reduction, valuable insights into the constituent microorganisms
and their metabolic interactions were obtained. To emulate natural
attenuation processes and unveil previously uncultivated degrading
functions, contaminated environmental samples were utilized in
conjunction with a selective enrichment method. This study built
upon previous efforts by applying a synthetic ecology approach to
tackle the degradation of PFOS, a highly persistent pollutant. By
elucidating microbial consortia with PFOS degradation capabilities,
innovative bioremediation strategies can be developed, and the
performance of these consortia can be optimized through
consortium design.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Chemicals and media
PFOS-K, characterized by the chemical formula C8F17KO3S, was
employed as a substitute for PFOS in our experiments due to its low
solubility in water. A mineral salt medium (MSM) was employed,
composed of the following components per liter: NaNO3 (0.5 g),
KH2PO4 (1.0 g), CaCl2 (0.02 g), MgSO4 (0.2 g), (NH4)2SO4 (0.5 g),
NaH2PO4·H2O (1.0 g), FeSO4·7H2O (0.001 g), and 2 mL of trace

## Page 10

element solution. The trace element solution was prepared as
follows per liter: MoO3 (0.001 g), ZnSO4·7H2O (0.007 g),
CuSO4·5H2O (0.0005 g), H3BO3 (0.001 g), MnSO4·5H2O (0.001 g),
CoCl2·6H2O (0.001 g), NiSO4·7H2O (0.001 g). Additionally, 0.1345
g of PFOS-K was added per liter of medium to achieve a PFOS
concentration of 0.25 mmol·L−1. The medium was sterilized at
121°C for 20 minutes. To enhance microbial utilization of PFOS and
its salts, co-metabolic substrates including glucose, n-octane, and
methanol were included in the media, maintaining a consistent
carbon content of 0.25 mmol·L−1. All chemicals and solvents used
were of analytical grade.
Soil samples were collected in the vicinity of a PFOS production
facility in Wuhan, China. Surface soil was obtained from multiple
locations and thoroughly mixed. After passing through a 2 mm soil
sieve, it was stored at 4°C.
2.2 Acquisition of microbial consortia
To obtain microbial consortia, 2 g of soil samples were added to the
medium and cultivated in a shaker at 30°C and 150 r/min for 20
days. Then, 2 mL of the culture was transferred to the same
medium. This process was repeated for three successive transfers,
and the PFOS-K concentration was assessed at the end of each
transfer cycle. The initial screening stage continued until the first
occurrence of decreased PFOS-K concentration. No replicates were
conducted during the initial screening stage. Following the initial
screening stage, three sets of replicates were established for all
media.
2.3 PFOS concentration

## Page 11

The pre-treatment of PFOS-K in the culture medium followed the
methodology described in the study by Huang and Jaffe [18]. PFOSK in the culture medium was diluted approximately 1000 times
with methanol. Subsequently, the samples were filtered through a
0.22 μm organic phase filter and injected into sample vials for
analysis. A standard curve for PFOS-K quantification was
established within the range of 10–150 μg·L−1. In both the samples
and the standard curve, 50 μg·L−1 of MPFOS-K was added as an
internal standard. Finally, the response ratio of PFOS-K/MPFOS-K
was used as the vertical coordinate, and the concentration of PFOSK was used as the horizontal coordinate to construct the standard
curve (Fig 1).

UPLC-MS (Waters ACQUITY UPLC H-Class PLUS & Xevo TQ-S
Micro) was employed for the detection of PFOS-K. The
chromatographic column utilized was a Waters BEH C18 column,
with mobile phase A consisting of a 5 mM aqueous solution of
acetic acid, and mobile phase B consisting of a methanol solution,
at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. A gradient elution program was
employed (see Table 1). The mass spectrometry parameters were as
follows: An ESI ion source was operated in negative ion mode with
multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) as the scanning method. The
capillary temperature was set at 350°C, the spray voltage at 3000

eV, the ion source temperature at 200°C, and the column oven
temperature at 30°C. The parent ion was 498.9, the daughter ion
was 80.2, and the collision energy was 55 eV.

2.4 DNA extraction and sequencing analysis
Following each generation of cultivation, 2 mL of the sample was
collected for DNA extraction. The extraction procedure was
conducted according to the instructions provided in the bacterial
whole-genome DNA extraction kit (TIANGEN TIANamp Bacteria
DNA kit-DP302). The V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene
was targeted for amplification using primers 338F
(ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA) and 806R
(GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT). The PCR reaction system consisted
of 25 μL of 2x Premix Taq, 1 μL of the forward primer, 1 μL of the
reverse primer, and 50 ng of template DNA. Nuclease-free water
was added to reach a final volume of 50 μL. PCR amplification was
performed using the BioRad S1000 system (Bio-Rad Laboratory,
CA). The resulting PCR products were analyzed through 1% agarose
gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, the amplified products were sent
to Shenzhen MAGIGENE Co., Ltd. (China) for sequencing.

2.5 Statistics and analysis
The raw data obtained from sequencing underwent processing and
modification using Fastp (Release 0.19.6, OpenGene/fastp) and
FLASH (Release 1.2.11, https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/FLASH/
index.shtml) software. Subsequently, the sequences were processed
utilizing QIIME, followed by OTU clustering and statistical analysis
performed using Uparse and Usearch (Release 7, http://
www.drive5.com/usearch/). To predict the KEGG and COG
functions of the bacterial 16S sequences, PICRUSt (Release 1.1.0,
http://picrust.github.io/picrust/) software was employed.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 PFOS-K concentration
The soil samples utilized in this study were acquired from the
vicinity of a PFOS production facility in China, aiming to capture
microbial communities that might have been exposed to and
acclimated to PFOS contamination over a prolonged period. Prior to
their utilization in the experiments, these soil samples underwent
thorough mixing and were sieved through a 2 mm mesh.
The microbial consortia were obtained through the addition of 2 g
of the soil samples to a MSM containing PFOS-K, followed by
incubation in a shaker at 30°C and 150 r/min for a duration of 20
days. This initial enrichment step was repeated thrice, with a 2 mL
aliquot of the culture transferred to fresh MSM medium after each

## Page 14

20-day incubation period. Monitoring of the PFOS-K concentration
occurred at the conclusion of each transfer cycle, enabling the
tracking of alterations in PFOS-K levels. The designation WH4
corresponds to the microbial consortium acquired through this
enrichment process, which exhibited a substantial reduction in
PFOS-K concentration when methanol was introduced as a cometabolic substrate during the initial screening.
Fig 2(a) demonstrates that, during the initial screening stage, a
53.3% decrease in PFOS-K concentration in the WH4 consortium on
the 20th day was observed when methanol was introduced as a cometabolic substrate. This decrease was compared to the control
group, which did not receive any co-metabolite. In contrast, Fig
2(b) reveals that when the WH4 consortium was exposed to other
co-metabolized substrates such as glucose or n-hexane, or when no
co-metabolite was provided, no significant reduction in PFOS-K
concentration was observed over the same time period. Hence, it
can be inferred that the presence of methanol specifically enhanced
the PFOS-K degradation capabilities of the WH4 consortium,
particularly during the initial screening stage.

A control experiment was conducted to investigate the potential
impact of methanol on PFOS-K concentration in the absence of
bacteria. The control experiment involved utilizing the same MSM
supplemented with PFOS-K and various co-metabolic substrates
(glucose, n-octane, and methanol), without the inclusion of any soil
sample or microbial inoculum. Throughout the abiotic control
incubations, the PFOS-K concentration remained stable. This
stability suggests that the observed decrease in PFOS-K levels within
the WH4 consortium was primarily attributed to the metabolic
activities of the microbial community, rather than being solely a
result of chemical interactions with the added substrates.
Furthermore, WH4 was passaged using MSM medium containing
PFOS-K, with methanol employed as a co-metabolic substrate. The
phenomenon of reduced PFOS-K concentration was observed in
both the second and third generations, with degradation rates of
26.1% and 39.6%, respectively (Fig 2c). However, as the number of
transmissions increased, the error gradually increased, and the
phenomenon disappeared in the fourth generation. To eliminate the
influence of adsorption, we centrifuged the bacterial solution from
the second generation and examined the supernatant to determine
the concentration of PFOS-K. It was observed that the concentration
of PFOS-K was significantly reduced compared to the control group,
thus ruling out the influence of adsorption (Fig 2d).
In this experiment, a decrease in PFOS-K concentration in the
microbial consortium was observed when methanol was added as a

## Page 16

co-metabolite. PFOS, being a recalcitrant pollutant, poses a
challenge for microorganisms to metabolize due to the limited
availability of carbon and energy sources [36]. However, the
addition of methanol can provide microorganisms with the
necessary energy and carbon sources, thereby promoting their
growth and metabolic activity. Furthermore, methanol can enhance
the activity of relevant enzymes in microbial metabolic pathways,
thereby accelerating the reaction rate of key processes and
improving degradation efficiency.
Previous research by Guo et al. [37] demonstrated that the addition
of methanol facilitated the debromination process of 2,2’,4,4’-
tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47). Methanol has been found to
promote pollutant degradation in various cases. For instance, it has
been shown to reduce the toxicity of coal chemical wastewater and
enhance the degradation rate of phenolic compounds. Shi et al. [38]
utilized methanol to enhance the biodegradation of phenolic and
NHCs in coal pyrolysis wastewater.
The influence of adsorption was investigated by analyzing the
PFOS-K concentration in the supernatant of the second-generation
WH4 culture compared to the control (Fig 3). The supernatant
derived from the second-generation bacterial solution of WH4,
obtained through centrifugation, exhibited a markedly lower PFOSK concentration compared to the control supernatant without
centrifugation. This finding effectively ruled out the impact of
adsorption and confirmed the genuine degradation of PFOS-K
within the WH4 consortium at this particular stage.

In order to examine the long-term sustainability of the observed
phenomenon of PFOS-K reduction in the WH4 consortium, the
concentration of PFOS-K was specifically monitored during the third
generation (Fig 4). The results revealed a persistent downward
trend in PFOS-K concentration until the third generation, indicating
continuous reduction of PFOS-K. However, the degradation rate
displayed a fluctuating pattern, and the error bars noticeably
widened, suggesting a destabilization of the phenomenon with
further subculturing. When considering these findings alongside the
previous observations, it can be inferred that the presence of
methanol as the auxiliary substrate may have ultimately hindered
the long-term PFOS degradation capability of the consortium during
serial transfer.

## Page 18

Regrettably, the reduction of PFOS-K cannot be sustained as the
number of generations increases. The analysis of the degradation
rate reveals an increasing standard deviation, indicating a loss of
stability in the phenomenon. Eventually, by the third generation,
the phenomenon disappears. It is hypothesized that the coexistence
of methanol may contribute to the unsustainability of this
phenomenon. The influence of methanol concentration on PFOS-K
degradation was investigated in first-generation samples (Fig 5). It
was observed that the degradation of PFOS-K was affected by the
amount of methanol added, with higher methanol concentrations
resulting in a decrease in the PFOS-K degradation rate. Organisms
possess various mechanisms to acquire new metabolic pathways
[39]. However, when pathways or processes serve the same
function, degeneration can occur, as seen in the case of the multiple
alternative pathways for glucose metabolism [40]. Methanol is
more readily utilized compared to PFOS-K, and the ability to
degrade PFOS-K may gradually diminish with successive
subculturing.

3.2 Microbial consortium structure
A relative abundance analysis at the genus level was conducted for
the first generation treatment using methanol as a co-metabolic
substrate. The results revealed that the WH4 group, which exhibited
a reduction in PFOS-K concentration, primarily consisted of two
species: Hyphomicrobium (46.7%) and unclassified microorganisms
(53.0%). Although Hyphomicrobium was also present in other
samples, its proportion was significantly lower, such as 1.1% in
WH4, whereas other samples exhibited a higher number of species
compared to WH4. Therefore, the microbial consortium structure of
WH4 was distinct from other groups, with the key difference being
the presence of Hyphomicrobium (see Fig 6).

Fig 6. Microbial consortium structure using methanol as a cometabolic substrate.
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0303904.g006
The microbial community composition within the WH4 consortium
was analyzed, revealing its primary composition of two dominant
taxonomic groups: Hyphomicrobium, responsible for 46.7% of the
total community, and a group of unclassified microorganisms,
representing 53.0% of the consortium. The most abundant genus

## Page 20

identified was Hyphomicrobium, while the remaining 53.0%
consisted of multiple unclassified operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) or amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that could not be
confidently assigned to known taxa at the species or genus level.
This composition suggests that the WH4 consortium, which
exhibited a notable reduction in PFOS-K concentration, was not
solely a binary culture composed of Hyphomicrobium and one other
unclassified species. Instead, it harbored a diverse but
uncharacterized microbial community, with Hyphomicrobium
acting as the predominant and potentially key player in the
observed PFOS-K degradation, while the unclassified members
likely contributed complementary metabolic capabilities or
provided supportive roles. The challenges associated with working
with complex consortia containing uncultured microorganisms are
underscored by the inability to isolate and functionally validate the
Hyphomicrobium strain, as mentioned in the manuscript.
Previous research has indicated that Hyphomicrobium harbors
dehalogenase enzymes capable of degrading various halogenated
compounds. For instance, Sun et al. [41] identified a microbial
community with the ability to degrade halogenated polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (HPAH), where the genus Hyphomicrobium
demonstrated efficient degradation of 9-BrAnt, 2-BrPhe, and 2ClPhe. Moreover, the dehalogenase gene dcm in Hyphomicrobium
exhibited some genetic variability. Hayoun et al. [42] discovered
that Hyphomicrobium sp. MC8b could degrade dichloromethane
(DCM) and identified a distinct set of genes through pan-proteomic
analysis, separate from the traditional dcm gene. PFOS, being a
halogenated compound, shares certain similarities with DCM. It is
highly plausible that the Hyphomicrobium present in our acquired
microbial consortium possesses some capability for PFOS
degradation. Unfortunately, isolating this strain for functional
validation was not feasible. Additionally, there were several
unclassified microorganisms in the consortium, which may have
contributed to the degradation process of Hyphomicrobium or
played a supportive role. Therefore, these microorganisms formed a

## Page 21

consortium through environmental filtering, but their functions
were not stable and eventually diminished.
To comprehend the potential shifts in the microbial community
structure that might have contributed to the observed decline in
PFOS-K degradation in later generations of the WH4 consortium, an
analysis of the bacterial community composition was conducted on
the 4th generation samples. The results unveiled a noteworthy
alteration in the relative abundances of dominant taxa when
compared to earlier generations.
In the 4th generation, there was a significant decrease in the
proportion of Hyphomicrobium, which had initially been the
predominant genus in the WH4 consortium, accounting for only
12.4% of the total community. Simultaneously, the relative
abundance of unclassified microorganisms also exhibited a decline,
reaching 29.6%. Conversely, other genera, such as Mycobacterium
(18.2%) and Sphingomonas (16.5%), became more prevalent in the
4th generation samples. This shift in the microbial community
structure suggests that the long-term stability and PFOS-K
degradation capability of the WH4 consortium were compromised
over successive subculturing, potentially attributable to the
decreasing dominance of the key Hyphomicrobium and unclassified
populations.
To shed further light on the relationship between methanol
availability and the microbial community structure, additional
experiments were conducted to monitor changes in the consortium
composition under varying methanol concentrations, with the
potential influence of PFOS-K excluded. The observed results
demonstrated that higher methanol concentrations (HC-M) elicited
a relative increase in the abundance of taxa known to utilize
methane or methanol as carbon sources, notably Methylobacterium
and Methylophilus. In contrast, lower methanol levels (LC-M)
fostered the proliferation of microorganisms possessing a more

## Page 22

diverse metabolic repertoire, including Hyphomicrobium and other
unclassified members. These findings suggest that maintaining a
balance between methanol-utilizing organisms and versatile
degraders within the consortium may emerge as a critical factor in
preserving the long-term PFOS-K degradation capabilities. The
preferential utilization of methanol may potentially outcompete the
PFOS-K degradation pathways over successive generations.
3.3 Predicting the potential function of the microbial
consortium
Insights into potential metabolic differences between the WH4
consortium and other sample groups were obtained through a
comparative functional prediction analysis based on 16S rRNA gene
sequences. A heatmap presenting the top 15 orthologous KEGG
pathways (k0-level) identified across distinct treatment points was
generated using Silva taxonomy, Tax4Fun, and KEGG annotation of
16S data (Fig 7a). A lower relative abundance of most pathways
was observed in WH4 compared to other samples, with only
k02051, k02049, and k02050 showing higher values, aligning with
their roles in amino acid transport. Furthermore, the 25 most
abundant COG functional categories present across samples were
identified (Fig 7b), revealing a lower abundance of 23 dominant
groups in WH4 and an elevated representation of RNA/cell
functions. This pattern likely arises from the effects of PFOS toxicity
on core metabolic processes.

A heatmap analysis of the top 15 orthologous genes in the firstgeneration treatment with methanol as a co-metabolic substrate was
performed, utilizing the Silva database 16S phylogeny, Tax4Fun,
PICRUSt conversion, and KEGG functional annotation of 16S RNA
gene sequences. Metabolic differences between the WH4 group and
other samples were observed. WH4 did not exhibit a higher relative
abundance for any k0 compared to other samples, and the relative
abundance of other metabolic pathways was also low. Only k02051,
k02049, and k02050 showed relatively higher abundance, but these
three metabolic pathways were also present at relatively high
abundance in other samples. These pathways are related to amino
acid transport [43] but are not exclusive to WH4, as the relative
abundance of such proteins was also high in WH2. Additionally, the
relative abundance of other proteins in WH4, when compared with
those in other samples, is comparatively lower. This includes
k01995-k01999, a cluster of proteins associated with branchedchain amino acid transport [44], as well as k03088 and k00799.
K03088 represents a class of RNA polymerases [45], while k00799
represents glutathione S-transferase, involved in the oxidative
breakdown of ingested sugars within cells [46]. The lower
abundance of k00799 may suggest that WH4 is more likely to
utilize carbon sources other than glucose, such as PFOS or
methanol.

## Page 24

In order to further investigate potential functional variations
between the WH4 consortium and the individual Hyphomicrobium
bacterium, we conducted an enrichment analysis utilizing the
complete genome sequence of Hyphomicrobium sp. strain MC1, a
recognized species capable of chloromethane degradation (Fig 7c).
The y-axis in this figure represents the relative abundance or
proportion of the selected KEGG pathways within the MC1 genome.
This comparative evaluation allows us to assess the enrichment or
depletion of these pathways in the reference Hyphomicrobium
strain, thereby facilitating the identification of potential functional
disparities between the individual bacterium and the WH4
microbial consortium. A chloromethane-degrading bacterium,
Hyphomicrobium sp. Strain MC1, with the complete genomic
sequence deposited in the GenBank/EMBL database under the
accession number FQ859181 [47], was selected. An enrichment
analysis was conducted on MC1’s complete genome based on the
KEGG database, selecting several pathways with relatively high
proportions for presentation. It was found that in MC1, k02051 and
k02049 have relatively high proportions, similar to the WH5
bacterial community, whereas k02050 is comparatively low in
proportion. K02051 and k02049 are ATP-binding protein and
substrate-binding protein of the NitT/TauT family transport system,
respectively, while k02050 is a permease of the transport system
[43]. This suggests subtle differences between the microbial
consortium and individual bacteria in some amino acid transport
pathways. Although no differences were found in terms of
dehalogenation, these slight discrepancies in metabolic pathways
might contribute to the functional differences between the
consortium and individual bacteria.
The 25 most abundant COG annotations across distinct sample
points were identified. In WH2, 23 functional groups exhibited a
comparatively higher abundance. In contrast, the abundance of
these 23 functional groups was lower in WH4, while the remaining
2 functional groups, associated with cell skeleton and RNA
processing and modification, showed higher relative abundance.
This phenomenon may be attributed to the toxic effects of
fluorinated substances that constrain cell growth [48]. Notably, the

## Page 25

relative abundance of functional groups related to lipid and
carbohydrate transport was lower in WH4 than in other treatments,
indicating the possibility of alternative nutrient transport
mechanisms in WH4. Nonetheless, PFOS toxicity adversely affects
diverse cellular functions.
4. Conclusion
The challenge of biodegrading recalcitrant pollutants such as PFOS
is significant due to their chemical stability and the limited
discovery of effective degrading microorganisms. Relying solely on
isolated bacterial strains is problematic due to gaps in individual
metabolic capabilities and their instability under changing
conditions. In this study, an attempt was made to address these
issues through a top-down functional screening of synthetic
microbial consortia enriched from long-term PFOS contaminated
soil.
Insights provided by our findings highlight the potential of
microbial partnerships in overcoming the intractability of
pollutants. A consortium primarily composed of Hyphomicrobium
(46.7%) and uncultivated microorganisms (53.0%) was identified,
demonstrating the ability to reduce PFOS concentration by 56.7%
over 20 days upon methanol supplementation. This microbial
partnership exhibited remarkable resilience under sustained PFOS
stress, persisting over two generations.
Detailed analyses of the composition and predicted functions of this
consortium offer novel perspectives. Although no specific
dehalogenation genes were identified, the WH4 group displayed
distinct metabolic profiles compared to other treatments and
individual Hyphomicrobium, with lower representation of pathways

## Page 26

involved in branched amino acid and RNA transport. Subtle
discrepancies in certain amino acid transporters within the
consortium, when compared to individual Hyphomicrobium
metabolism, may partially account for the observed differences in
degradation activities.
These findings suggest that the unclassified community members
play a supportive metabolic role, complementing the inherent PFOS
degradation capacity of Hyphomicrobium. Methanol
supplementation facilitated core growth processes by mitigating
toxicity, temporarily enhancing the degradation proficiency of this
partnership. However, the preferential utilization of methanol
eventually compromised stability upon serial transfer, highlighting
the need for optimization of cultivation strategies.
The limitations associated with using functional prediction tools
like PICRUSt on microbial communities where a substantial portion
of the members remain unclassified should be acknowledged. The
availability of reference genome data, which is often lacking for
uncultured and uncharacterized microorganisms, heavily influences
these in silico approaches. In the case of the WH4 consortium,
where 53.0% of the members were unclassified at the species or
genus level, caution should be exercised when interpreting the
functional predictions derived from 16S rRNA gene sequences. The
aim of the PICRUSt analysis performed in this study was to provide
insights into the potential metabolic capabilities of the WH4
consortium, but it may not accurately represent the full functional
potential of the community. The unclassified members, constituting
a significant proportion, likely harbor novel and uncharted
metabolic pathways that are not captured by the reference genomes
utilized by PICRUSt. Furthermore, the individual-based functional
predictions may not adequately reflect the complex interspecies
interactions and synergistic metabolic activities within the
consortium.

## Page 27

To overcome these limitations, alternative approaches such as
metagenomics and metatranscriptomics should be explored in
future studies. These techniques can provide a more comprehensive
and unbiased assessment of the functional potential and gene
expression profiles within microbial consortia. By employing these
methods, a better understanding of the actual metabolic capabilities
contributing to the observed PFOS degradation, including the roles
of the unclassified members, can be achieved.
Therefore, this study emphasizes the potential of synthetic
microbial ecology approaches in unlocking the decomposition
abilities of otherwise inaccessible pollutants. Understanding
consortia capable of attenuating pollutants paves the way for
optimized bioremediation strategies targeting persistent
contaminants like PFOS. Future studies that harness characterized
consortia through domestication regimes have the potential to
unleash their full degradation capabilities at larger scales.
Addressing ecological challenges through interspecies metabolic
cooperation showcases the broad importance and practical
applications of this field.
