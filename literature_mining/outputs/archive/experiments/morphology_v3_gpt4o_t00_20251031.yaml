  Motile bacteria take a competitive advantage in colonization of plant surfaces 
  to establish beneficial associations that eventually support plant health. Plant 
  exudates serve not only as primary growth substrates for bacteria but also as 
  bacterial chemotaxis attractants. A number of plant-derived compounds and 
  corresponding chemotaxis sensors have been documented, however, the 
  sensors for methanol, one of the major volatile compounds released by plants, 
  have not been identified. Methylobacterium species are ubiquitous plant surfacesymbiotic, methylotrophic bacteria. A plant-growth promoting bacterium, M. 
  aquaticum strain 22A exhibits chemotaxis toward methanol (methylotaxis). Its 
  genome encodes 52 methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), among 
  which we identified three MCPs (methylotaxis proteins, MtpA, MtpB, and MtpC) 
  responsible for methylotaxis. The triple gene mutant of the MCPs exhibited no 
  methylotaxis, slower gathering to plant tissues, and less efficient colonization 
  on plants than the wild type, suggesting that the methylotaxis mediates initiation 
  of plant-Methylobacterium symbiosis and engages in proliferation on plants. To 
  examine how these MCPs are operating methylotaxis, we  generated multiple 
  gene knockouts of the MCPs, and Ca2+-dependent MxaFI and lanthanide (Ln3+)-
  dependent XoxF methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs), whose expression is regulated 
  by the presence of Ln3+. MtpA was found to be a cytosolic sensor that conducts 
  formaldehyde taxis (formtaxis), as well as methylotaxis when MDHs generate 
  formaldehyde. MtpB contained a dCache domain and exhibited differential 
  cellular localization in response to La3+. MtpB expression was induced by La3+, and 
  its activity required XoxF1. MtpC exhibited typical cell pole localization, required 
  MxaFI activity, and was regulated under MxbDM that is also required for MxaF 
  expression. Strain 22A methylotaxis is realized by three independent MCPs, two 
  of which monitor methanol oxidation by Ln3+-regulated MDHs, and one of which 
  monitors the common methanol oxidation product, formaldehyde. We propose 
  that methanol metabolism-linked chemotaxis is the key factor for the efficient 
  colonization of Methylobacterium on plants.

  Introduction
  Microbial plant colonizers recognize the existence of plants by 
  sensing the chemicals released by plants to establish their symbiotic 
  or pathogenic relationships (Scharf et al., 2016). Most motile bacteria 
  have an array of sensors called methyl-accepting chemotaxis receptors 
  (MCPs). MCPs and the cooperating Che system that transmits the 
  signals from MCPs to the flagellar motor regulate the direction of 
  flagellar rotation and enable attractant-directed swimming, defined as 
  chemotaxis (Karmakar, 2021). The chemotaxis mechanism has been 
  extensively studied using Escherichia coli as a model organism. The 
  E. coli genome encodes five MCP genes, whose detailed function and 
  their ligands have been studied well (Sourjik and Armitage, 2010). In 
  contrast, plant-colonizing bacteria possess huge numbers of MCPs. 
  For example, Rhizobium species have 15 to 30 MCPs, Agrobacterium 
  species have 20 to 40 MCPs, and Bradyrhizobium species have 30 to 
  60 MCPs (Scharf et al., 2016). These receptors typically contain an 
  N-terminal ligand-binding region and a C-terminal signaling region 
  containing a methyl-accepting domain. The ligand-binding domains 
  of the large majority (~88%) of bacterial MCPs have not been 
  annotated (Lacal et al., 2010).
  Methylobacterium species are ubiquitous methylotrophic 
  colonizers on plant aerial surfaces (phyllosphere), and they can occupy 
  10 to 20% of total culturable bacteria on plant surfaces (Vorholt, 
  2012). Methanol released by plants as a byproduct of pectin 
  degradation (Fall and Benson, 1996) offers a niche for methylotrophic 
  bacteria. Plant-associated methylotrophic bacteria are also capable of 
  synthesizing phytohormones that can affect plant growth, resulting in 
  plant growth promotion (Dourado et  al., 2015). Thus, 
  Methylobacterium species are recognized as mutual symbionts 
  for plants.
  Methylobacterium species oxidize methanol mainly using two 
  different methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs), MxaFI and XoxF. The 
  former is a calcium (Ca2+)-dependent enzyme, whereas the latter was 
  found to be a lanthanide (Ln3+)-dependent enzyme (Anderson et al., 
  1990; Hibi et al., 2011; Nakagawa et al., 2012; Keltjens et al., 2014). 
  Another Ln3+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase, ExaF, was found in 
  Methylorubrum extorquens strain AM1 (Good et  al., 2016) and 
  Methylobacterium aquaticum strain 22A (Yanpirat et  al., 2020). 
  Recognition and transport of Ln3+, Ln3+-dependent regulation of 
  methylotrophy genes, and catalytic and regulatory activity of XoxF are 
  currently emerging fields of study on methylotrophic bacteria 
  (Skovran et al., 2011; Vu et al., 2016; Ochsner et al., 2019; RoszczenkoJasińska et al., 2020). Though Lns are included in “rare earth metals,” 
  the concentration of Ln3+ in soils is not low and is almost equivalent 
  to those of copper, cobalt, and zinc (Kamenopoulos et al., 2016). XoxF 
  is more widespread in methylotrophic bacteria than MxaF and is 
  believed to be closer to an ancient form of MDHs (Chistoserdova, 
  2019; Skovran et al., 2019). Thus, Ln3+ has a pivotal regulatory role in 
  the methylotrophy and physiology of methylotrophic bacteria (Tani 
  et al., 2021).
  Methylobacterium aquaticum strain 22A is an isolate from a 
  hydroponic culture of a moss, Racomitrium japonicum, and is also a 
  potent plant growth promoter (Tani et al., 2012). The strain has the 
  MDHs described above (MxaFI and XoxF1) as well as ExaF (Tani 
  et al., 2015; Masuda et al., 2018; Yanpirat et al., 2020). XoxF1 and ExaF 
  are induced by Ln3+, whereas MxaF is induced in the absence of Ln3+. 
  For formaldehyde oxidation, the strain employs two different 
  pathways, the H4MPT pathway and the GSH pathway (Yanpirat 
  et al., 2020).
  The 22A genome encodes as many as 52 MCPs. As reported 
  previously, we found that some bacteria including Methylobacterium 
  species exhibit chemotaxis toward methanol (Tola et al., 2019). In this 
  study, we revealed that strain 22A has three MCPs each responsible 
  for chemotaxis towards methanol and its metabolite formaldehyde 
  (here we  define methylotaxis and formtaxis, respectively), the 
  methylotaxis is realized by the coordination of MCPs with the 
  methanol metabolism that is regulated by Ln3+, and the methylotaxis 
  has a critical role in locating plants.
  Results
  Identification of three MCPs involved in 
  methylotaxis
  A microscopy-aided capillary-plug assay was employed to assess 
  chemotaxis activity. Strain 22A methylotaxis was inducible by 
  methanol (Supplementary Figure S1). Strain 22A cells were incubated 
  in HEPES buffer (20 mM, pH 7.0) at 20°C for 2 h after overnight 
  cultivation on methanol (as optimized in Supplementary 
  Figures S1B,C). Strain 22A exhibited taxis toward DL-malate, 
  DL-glycerate, and L-glutamate (Supplementary Figure S1D). The 
  amino acid sequences of 52 MCP genes encoded in the strain 22A 
  genome conserve a common MCP signal domain at their C-terminus 
  in most cases, and other different domains, such as dCache, 4HB_
  MCP_1, and HAMP domains (Supplementary Figure S2). 
  We generated single-gene knockout mutants for 15 genes that are 
  induced by methanol in the transcriptome data of strain 22A (Masuda 
  et al., 2018), but none of the mutants lost methylotaxis completely 
  (Supplementary Figure S3). Because mtpA knockout strain (maq22A_
  c14925, ΔmtpA) exhibited significantly weaker methylotaxis than the 
  wild type, we hypothesized that strain 22A has multiple methylotaxis 
  MCPs. Then, we generated multi-gene knockouts based on ΔmtpA 
  mutant. The additional knockouts of mtpB (maq22A_1p32440) and 
  mtpC (maq22A_c15300) that also showed weaker methylotaxis in the 
  screening, resulted in a complete loss of methylotaxis. Hereafter 
  we call ΔmtpAΔmtpBΔmtpC mutant the TM (triple gene mutant).
  The TM grown on methanol in the presence and absence of LaCl3 
  did not exhibit any methylotaxis (Figure 1A) but retained chemotaxis 
  toward yeast extract (2%) used as a mixture of amino acids. These 
  results suggested that the mutant is not impaired in its chemotaxis 
  machinery but only in attractant recognition and that the taxis 
  response of La3+ is specific to methanol.
  In MtpA amino acid sequence we detected only an MCP signaling 
  domain (Figure 1B) involved in its dimerization and interaction with 
  CheA protein and the adaptor protein CheW. The absence of the 
  transmembrane region suggested that MtpA operates in the 
  cytoplasm. MtpB contains a putative signal peptide, dCache_1 
  domain, a transmembrane domain, and a HAMP domain. The 
  dCache_1 is the predominant sensor domain that recognizes wide 
  variety of compounds including proteinogenic amino acids, 
  polyamines, quaternary amines, purines, organic acids, sugars, 
  quorum sensing signals, or inorganic ions (Matilla et al., 2021). The 
  HAMP domain transmits the outside signal into the cytosol 
  (Parkinson, 2010). MtpC contains a signal peptide, a transmembrane

  region, and a HAMP domain, exhibiting a typical structure of general 
  MCPs. The predicted periplasmic domain has no sign for any known 
  domains. Thus, we concluded that MtpA has atypical topology IV 
  (cytosolic receptor), and MtpB and MtpC have typical topology I with 
  an extracellular ligand binding domain, according to the classification 
  by Lacal et al. (2010).
  The single-gene knockouts of three MCPs exhibited different 
  intensities of methylotaxis (Figure 1C). Deletion of mtpA resulted in 
  a significant decrease in methylotaxis activity, suggesting its major 
  contribution to cellular methylotaxis. Whereas methylotaxis of 
  ∆mtpA and ∆mtpC mutants was not affected by the presence of LaCl3, 
  ΔmtpB mutant exhibited weaker methylotaxis when it is grown on 
  methanol in the presence of LaCl3 (hereafter called the MeOH+La 
  condition) than when it is grown on methanol in the absence of LaCl3 
  (MeOH-La condition), suggesting that MtpB contributes to 
  methylotaxis more in the presence of La3+. Indeed, mtpB expression is 
  approximately twofold increased by La3+ (Supplementary Figure S3).
  Then we examined the sensitivity and Ln-dependency of the 
  methylotaxis of the double gene knockouts (Figure 1D), and found 
  that MtpA is a relatively sensitive sensor, MtpB is a relatively lesssensitive sensor operating in the presence of La3+, and MtpC is a 
  relatively less-sensitive sensor operating in the absence of La3+. These

  data indicated that each MCP with different sensitivity operates 
  independently, and their expression and activity depend on the 
  availability of La3+.
  The methylotaxis MCPs were expressed as green fluorescent 
  protein (GFP)(C-terminal)-fusion proteins under the control of their 
  promoters in strain 22A wild type, and their cellular localization was 
  examined with confocal microscopy (Figure 1E). The promoter-less 
  vector control did not exhibit any fluorescence. MtpA-GFP 
  localization was observed in the cytoplasm, as predicted above. The 
  MtpB-GFP signal was observed at the pole of the cells grown in the 
  MeOH-La condition, whereas interestingly, it was observed at the cell 
  periphery in the MeOH+La condition. The MtpC-GFP signal was 
  observed at the cell pole. It is known that essentially all of the MCP 
  molecules cluster together with CheA and CheW to form the 
  chemotaxis sensory array at the cell pole (Briegel et al., 2009).
  The methylotaxis MCP genes with their promoter region were 
  PCR-amplified and cloned into pAT01 (Fujitani et  al., 2022) to 
  generate pAT01-MtpA, -MtpB, and-MtpC. The methylotaxis of TM 
  transformed with these plasmids was examined (Supplementary 
  Figure S4). The TM carrying pAT01-MtpA showed comparable 
  methylotaxis activity irrespective to the presence of LaCl3. The TM 
  carrying pAT01-MtpB and-MtpC showed higher methylotaxis when 
  grown in the presence and absence of LaCl3, respectively. These 
  responses to La3+ were in line with the result obtained in 
  Figure 1D. These gene complementation experiments indicated that 
  the phenotype of the mutants was caused by the MCP gene deletion 
  and not by polar effect.
  The TM exhibited no growth defect on methanol, irrespective of 
  the presence of La3+ (Supplementary Figure S5), suggesting that the 
  methylotaxis MCPs are not involved in methanol metabolism and 
  its regulation.
  Methylotaxis engages in locating plants 
  and phyllospheric growth
  To examine whether methylotaxis is involved in locating plants, 
  first, we quantified the methanol exuded by rice roots in hydroponic 
  culture (Supplementary Figure S6). After 8 h of seedling 
  transplantation, the methanol concentration in the medium reached 
  a maximum (3.5 mM = 0.01% w/v) and then gradually decreased. The 
  methanol exudation rate was calculated to be  approximately 
  0.113 mmol (=3.6 mg)/g plant fresh weight/h.
  The taxis toward Arabidopsis and rice roots was examined by 
  counting the number of cells gathered and attached to the roots after 
  soaking the roots in the cell suspensions (Figure 2A). The wild-type 
  cells gathered to plant roots rapidly, but the TM exhibited less efficient 
  gathering in the tested duration. These results suggested that the 
  methanol and methylotaxis of strain 22A engage in locating the plants. 
  The strain 22A wild-type cells gather at specific sites at the edge of 
  Arabidopsis leaves, where they swim around actively (Figure 2B). 
  These sites should be stomata or hydathodes, which are most possibly 
  the sites releasing methanol.
  To reveal the physiological role of methylotaxis in the 
  phyllosphere, the ability of seed-inoculated strain 22A and TM to 
  colonize plant leaves was compared. The cells were labeled with the 
  fluorescent protein mVenus and inoculated on sterilized red perilla 
  seeds that were cultivated aseptically. During cultivation, the cells 
  washed off from the leaves were quantified by flow cytometry. 
  Whereas the cell number of TM remained low during the course of 
  experiment, at certain time points (e.g., at 55 and 96 days) the number 
  of wild-type cells was significantly higher than that of TM cells 
  (Figure 2C). These large fluctuations might be due to plasmid loss in 
  the non-selective experimental setup and also to ununiform 
  colonization pattern of the cells on individual plants and leaves. Leafimprinting also indicated that the wild type 22A colonized red perilla 
  leaves more widely and densely than the TM (Figure 2D). These 
  results suggested that methylotaxis contributes to efficient colonization 
  in the phyllosphere.
  Formtaxis as a metabolism-linked 
  methylotaxis
  Methylobacterium species oxidize methanol rapidly with MDHs, 
  and the product formaldehyde is taken into the cytosol for further 
  oxidation and assimilation. However, it is also released extracellularly 
  (Masuda et al., 2018) from the periplasm where the oxidation by 
  MDHs occurs. If strain 22A is chemotactic to formaldehyde, the 
  methylotaxis observed above may include formtaxis. Strain 22A 
  exhibited formtaxis irrespective of La3+ and the TM did not exhibit any 
  formtaxis (Figure  3A). This result suggested that any of the 
  methylotaxis MCP(s) is also involved in formtaxis, and no MCPs 
  other than these three MCPs encoded in the genome are involved in 
  formtaxis, as long as the strain is grown in the used conditions.
  Next, we examined the formtaxis in double-gene knockouts of 
  methylotaxis MCPs with varied concentrations of formaldehyde 
  (Figure 3B). The wild type exhibited stronger formtaxis when grown 
  in the MeOH-La condition than in the MeOH+La condition, and the 
  best concentration of formaldehyde was 0.2%. ΔmtpBΔmtpC mutant 
  exhibited strong formtaxis compared to the wild type, for the high 
  concentration of formaldehyde (2%) only when it was grown in the 
  MeOH-La condition. ΔmtpAΔmtpC mutant exhibited moderate 
  formtaxis when grown in the MeOH-La condition, for 0.2% 
  formaldehyde. ΔmtpAΔmtpB mutant exhibited almost no formtaxis 
  at any tested concentrations of formaldehyde. Thus, MtpC is involved 
  only in methylotaxis and not in formtaxis.
  Strain 22A did not exhibit any taxis toward 2 and 0.2% formate 
  that is also a metabolite in methylotrophic pathway (data not shown), 
  although formate serves as a chemoattractant for a soil plant pathogen, 
  Agrobacterium fabrum strain C58 (Wang et al., 2021).
  The strain 22A genome encodes genes for the H4MPT pathway 
  that plays a central role in formaldehyde oxidation, starting with the 
  reaction catalyzed by the formaldehyde-activating enzyme (Fae). 
  Strain 22A has two homologous fae genes (fae1 and fae2). Strain 22A 
  (and many other Methylobacterium strains in the C1 clade, Alessa 
  et al., 2021) have additional glutathione-dependent formaldehyde 
  oxidation pathway (GSH pathway) genes composed of gfa 
  (glutathione-dependent formaldehyde-activating enzyme), hgd 
  (S-hydroxymethyl 
  glutathione 
  dehydrogenase), 
  and 
  fgh 
  (S-formylglutathione hydrolase). The Δfae1Δfae2Δhgd mutant is 
  completely defective in formaldehyde metabolism and unable to grow 
  even on succinate in the presence of methanol, due to formaldehyde 
  toxicity (Yanpirat et al., 2020). The mutant grown in the absence of 
  methanol did not lose methylotaxis and formtaxis (Figure  3C), 
  suggesting that methylotaxis and formtaxis do not require the

  formaldehyde metabolic pathways. Whereas the chemotactic cells 
  usually gather and swim around the capillary mouth in the assay, the 
  mutant cells could no longer swim once gathered around the capillary, 
  suggesting that they were toxified by formaldehyde (data not shown). 
  The Δfae1Δfae2Δhgd mutant exhibited stronger formtaxis than the 
  wild type in the presence of La3+, the possible reason for which is 
  discussed below.
  Examination of the relationships between 
  MDHs and MCPs revealed that MtpA is 
  responsible for formtaxis
  To examine the involvement of MDHs in methylotaxis and 
  formtaxis, we tested MDH gene knockouts of strain 22A grown on 
  succinate plus methanol. XoxF1 is necessary for the expression of 
  MxaF, therefore, ΔxoxF1 mutant cannot grow on methanol, 
  irrespective of La3+. ΔmxaF mutant can grow on methanol only in the 
  presence of La3+ due to intact XoxF1. ΔxoxF1Sup mutant is a 
  suppression mutant derived from ΔxoxF1 mutant that carries a 
  mutation in mxbD encoding a sensor kinase responsible for mxaF 
  expression, and the mutant restored the mxaF-dependent growth on 
  methanol without xoxF1 (Yanpirat et al., 2020).
  ΔxoxF1 and ΔxoxF1ΔmxaF mutants did not exhibit any 
  methylotaxis but retained formtaxis (Figure 4). ∆mxaF mutant grown 
  in the presence of La3+ and ∆xoxF1Sup retained methylotaxis. Thus, 
  either of the active MDHs is necessary for methylotaxis, and formtaxis 
  does not necessitate active MDHs. Namely, there may be MCP(s) that 
  recognize(s) formaldehyde.
  To differentiate which of methanol and formaldehyde is 
  recognized by each MCP, we generated double methylotaxis MCP 
  gene knockouts in the background of a series of MDH gene 
  knockouts (Figure 4). All mutants were motile under microscopic 
  observation, and TM under ∆mxaF∆xoxF1 background exhibited 
  wild-type level of taxis toward yeast extract (data not shown), 
  supporting the idea that the defect in methylotaxis was not due to the 
  loss of swimming motility.
  The ΔmtpBΔmtpC knockout mutants under ΔxoxF1 and 
  ΔmxaFΔxoxF1 backgrounds retained formtaxis irrespective of 
  La3+, 
  whereas 
  they 
  lost 
  methylotaxis, 
  suggesting 
  that

  MtpA-dependent methylotaxis depends on formaldehyde 
  generation by MDHs, and MtpA-dependent formtaxis does not 
  require MDHs. Therefore, MtpA is responsible for formtaxis. The 
  relatively high formtaxis in ΔmtpBΔmtpC mutant under 
  ΔmxaFΔxoxF1 background in the presence of La3+ might be due 
  to formaldehyde generation by ExaF that is active for methanol as 
  well as ethanol. Interestingly, the ΔmtpBΔmtpC mutant under 
  ΔxoxF1Sup background exhibited high methylotaxis and 
  formtaxis. ΔxoxF1Sup mutant constitutively and highly expresses 
  mxaF. Therefore, formaldehyde generated by MxaF might 
  promote the taxis.
  The vector for the MtpA-GFP construct was introduced into the 
  TM, 
  and 
  the 
  transformant 
  exhibited 
  formtaxis 
  (Supplementary Figure S7), suggesting that the cytosol-localized 
  GFP-tagged MtpA (Figure 1E) is functional.
  MtpB depends on MDH activity and La3+
  The ΔmtpAΔmtpC mutants under any MDH knockouts lost 
  methylotaxis and formtaxis in the absence of La3+ (Figure 4), partly 
  because the expression of mtpB is low in the absence of 
  La3+(Supplementary Figure S3). In the presence of La3+, the 
  ΔmtpAΔmtpC mutant under ΔmxaF and ΔxoxF1Sup backgrounds 
  retained low but significant levels of taxis, because either of the MDHs 
  is operating in these mutants.
  The strong formtaxis exhibited in Δfae1Δfae2Δhgd mutant in the 
  presence of La3+ (Figure  3C) might be  due to the formaldehyde 
  accumulation caused by the mutation and the participation of the 
  MtpB activity sensing XoxF1-dependent formaldehyde oxidation.
  Strain 22A grown on methanol also exhibited ethanol-taxis, and 
  the assay with double MCP gene knockouts suggested that MtpB 
  contributes most to the ethanol-taxis (Supplementary Figure S8A). 
  TM exhibited weak activity in the absence of La3+, suggesting that 
  strain 22A has other unidentified MCPs for ethanol-taxis that operate, 
  especially in the absence of La3+. The methylotaxis activity was 
  competitively lost in the presence of high concentrations of ethanol 
  (Supplementary Figure S8B).
  MtpC activity necessitates MxaF and is 
  under the regulation of MxbDM
  The ΔmtpAΔmtpB mutants exhibited almost no methylotaxis or 
  formtaxis under backgrounds of ΔmxaF, ΔxoxF1, and ΔmxaFΔxoxF1, 
  but exhibited strong taxis for both attractants under a ΔxoxF1Sup 
  background (Figure 4), suggesting that the activity or expression of 
  MtpC depends on MxaF. To examine whether the expression of MtpC 
  depends on the expression of mxaF, we  measured the promoter 
  activity of mtpC (PmtpC) in various MDH knockouts using a promoterreporter (luciferase) vector (Figure 5). The PmtpC activity was notably 
  higher in ΔxoxF1Sup mutant, and negligible in ΔxoxF1 and 
  ΔmxaFΔxoxF1 mutants. The PmtpC activity was not lost in ΔmxaF 
  mutant, suggesting that the expression of mtpC is not dependent on 
  the presence of mxaF. Therefore, we conclude that MtpC is dependent 
  on MxaF activity but not on its expression. Namely, the ligand for 
  MtpC is not methanol.
  mxaF expression is dependent on the presence of xoxF1 and a 
  two-component signaling system, MxbDM. The PmtpC activity was 
  abolished almost completely in the ∆mxbD mutant, suggesting that 
  mtpC expression is under regulation by mxbDM, which also 
  regulates mxaF.

  Discussion
  Chemotaxis is one of the bacterial survival strategies that enable 
  the cells to reach nutrients, and also to establish symbiotic and 
  associative relationships between hosts and microorganisms (AllardMassicotte et al., 2016; Scharf et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2019). Previously, 
  we showed that environmental bacteria including Methylobacterium 
  species exhibited methylotaxis (Tola et  al., 2019). However, its 
  molecular mechanism and contribution to bacterial survival have 
  remained elusive. In this study, we proved that a methylotrophic 
  plant–growth promoting bacterium M. aquaticum strain 22A has as 
  many as three MCPs for methylotaxis (Figure 1).
  Strain 22A utilizes methylotaxis to locate the plant and to initiate 
  symbiosis, and gathers in specific niches of natural openings, such as 
  stomata and hydathodes (Figures 2A,B). The seed-inoculated TM 
  exhibited less efficient colonization on perilla leaves than the wild type 
  (Figures 2C,D). It is currently unknown whether this is a result of the 
  fewer opportunities to reach favorable niches that eventually support 
  bacterial cell proliferation or the cellular spontaneous migration from 
  seeds to leaves on the plant surface or through internal tissues of the 
  vascular system (Chi et al., 2005; Ji et al., 2010). Methylotaxis is one of 
  the survival strategies that enable Methylobacterium cells to reach 
  nutrients and to establish symbiosis with plants.
  Although three MCPs are involved in the same cellular function 
  of methylotaxis, they operate independently and have distinctly 
  different characteristics in their secondary structures, induction 
  response to La3+, sensitivity, and cellular localization. To add an 
  evolutionary viewpoint to their function and conservation, 
  we examined MCP genes in the genomes of 62 type strains of the 
  genera (1,467 MCP genes in total, 23.3 genes per genome, 
  Supplementary Table S1). The type strains of clade A and C with 
  relatively larger genomic sizes contain relatively larger numbers of 
  MCP genes (average: 34 genes). We  also tested the methylotaxis 
  activity of the type strains grown in the MeOH+La condition that 
  supports the growth of all type strains. Twenty-six strains among the 
  tested 60 type strains exhibited swimming motility, and all of them 
  exhibited methylotaxis with different intensities. The methylotaxis 
  MCP genes found in this study were not necessarily conserved in 
  these strains, suggesting that another type of methylotaxis MCP exists.
  MtpA was found to function in the cytosol (Figure  1E; 
  Supplementary Figure S7) and is primarily responsible for formtaxis 
  (Figure 3B), but also engages in methylotaxis when MDH is functional 
  (Figure 4). MtpA is considered to be a sensor for methylotaxis that 
  navigates the cells to the place where more formaldehyde is produced. 
  Although formaldehyde can also be detected in plants (Blunden et al., 
  1998), considering the difference in sensitivity of methylotaxis and 
  formtaxis (Figures 1D, 3B), abundant methanol emission from plants 
  (Supplementary Figure S6), and ubiquity of functional MDHs in 
  Methylobacterium species, methylotaxis would first be prioritized to 
  locate plants in nature. It is reported that E. coli cells are supposed to 
  secrete serine upon being attracted by aspartic acid, and serine is used 
  as a signaling molecule to attract other cells (Long et al., 2017). The 
  formaldehyde secreted by the methanol-oxidizing cells may serve as a 
  secondary signal to gather other Methylobacterium cells and to 
  enhance the colonization of the species. Although MtpA is conserved 
  in clade C members (Supplementary Table S1) in which the GSH 
  pathway is also conserved (Alessa et al., 2021), the formtaxis did not 
  necessitate the formaldehyde metabolism pathways. Thus, it is unlikely 
  that a metabolic intermediate (such as S-formylglutathione, H4MPT, 
  etc.) in the pathways is the ligand for MtpA. The clade C members are 
  considered to be  evolutionary ancestors that may prefer soil, 
  rhizosphere, or aquatic environments to the phyllosphere (Leducq 
  et al., 2022). It is interesting to hypothesize that MtpA-dependent 
  formtaxis may contribute to colonizing a niche by convening 
  colleagues in such environments. There is no hint for ligand based on 
  MtpA structural information. It is reported that about one-quarter of

  bacteria cytoplasmic chemoreceptors had no identifiable domain, 
  whereas about half of analyzed chemoreceptors contain PAS domain 
  that is involved mainly in energy taxis (Collins et  al., 2014). 
  Identification of the ligand for MtpA is currently underway.
  MtpB was found to depend on MDH activity and La3+ (Figure 4). 
  Its cellular localization changed in response to La3+ (Figure 1E), which 
  is unique, as well as reasonable to detect the MDH activity that operate 
  in the periplasm. The molecular mechanism that regulates and alters 
  the protein localization is unknown. As one of the examples of 
  differential localization of MCP protein, the Azospirillum brasilense 
  aerotaxis sensor AerC exhibits different localization: the cell pole in 
  the nitrogen fixation condition and the cytosol in the presence of 
  ammonium (Xie et  al., 2010). The dCache_1 domain generally 
  recognizes various compounds, and majority of known ligands are 
  amino acids (Upadhyay et al., 2016). Because its activity depends on 
  MDH activity, the ligand for MtpB is not methanol itself. MDH genes 
  (mxaFI and xoxF1) are associated with solute-binding protein genes 
  (mxaJ and xoxJ) in each cluster. mxaJ deletion in M. extorquens AM1 
  resulted in disruption of MxaFI activation (Amaratunga et al., 1997). 
  MxaJ is suggested to be crucial for MxaFI maturation, however, its 
  exact role is unknown. On the other hand, solute binding proteins are 
  known to function as ligands for many different types of signal 
  transduction receptors, including MCPs that contain dCache, HBM 
  or TarH domains (Matilla et al., 2021). Therefore, it is possible that the 
  ligand for MtpB is XoxJ. MtpB is also involved in formtaxis and 
  ethanol-taxis (Supplementary Figure S8) due to the formaldehyde and 
  ethanol oxidation capacity of XoxF1. Ethanol is released from plants 
  (Fall, 1999), and is also a good growth substrate for strain 22A 
  (Yanpirat et al., 2020). Most probably, ethanol-taxis is dependent on 
  MtpB and XoxF1 or ExaF activity. As we  reported previously, 
  FIGURE 5

  succinate, or methanol plus succinate in the absence/presence of La3+ in liquid medium prepared in 96-well plates. The data were analyzed with 
  analysis of variance followed by Dunnet’s test to compare the differences against wild-type data. p values lower than 0.01 are indicated by asterisks. 
  The data are shown as mean luminescence/OD600  ±  SD (n  =  4). n.g., no growth.

  Ln3+-dependent methylotrophy is completely conserved in the genera 
  whereas some strains lack the mxa cluster (Alessa et al., 2021), and 
  XoxF-type MDH is considered to be  ancestral to MxaF-type 
  MDH. Therefore, it is reasonable that MtpB monitoring XoxF1 activity 
  is conserved widely in the genera (Supplementary Table S1). MtpB is 
  relatively less conserved in clade D members that have relatively 
  smaller genomes as well as smaller numbers of MCPs. Clade D 
  contains specialized forest tree phyllospheric members (Leducq et al., 
  2022) that may have limited access to Ln3+.
  MtpC was found to be associated with MxaF activity (Figure 4). 
  Its expression is independent of mxaF expression but dependent on 
  mxbD, which regulates mxaF expression in the absence of La3+ 
  (Figure  6). Thus, mxbD regulates not only MxaF-dependent 
  methylotrophy but also methylotaxis when Ln3+ is not available. As 
  one of the similar regulators, ArcA from avian pathogenic E. coli also 
  controls chemotaxis as well as metabolism and motility (Jiang et al., 
  2015). Because MtpC cellular localization did not change in response 
  to La3+, and its amino acid sequence does not contain any known 
  domains, its mode of action may differ from that of MtpB. MtpC will 
  not bind methanol directly as a ligand, and it is unknown how MtpC 
  activity cooperates with MxaF activity. MtpC appeared randomly 
  across the type strain genomes but not in the strains that lack mxa 
  genes (M. tardum NBRC 103632T, M. longum DSM 23933T, 
  M. persicinum NBRC 103628T, M. komagatae DSM 19563T, and 
  M. iners DSM 19015T; Supplementary Table S1, Alessa et al., 2021), 
  implying the functional and evolutionary link between MtpC 
  and MxaFI.
  Thus, strain 22A is equipped with as many as three distinct MCPs 
  that enable its methylotaxis with different mechanisms. They navigate 
  the cells to the niche where methanol is more available by monitoring 
  FIGURE 6
  A schematic representation of the putative mechanism of strain 22A methylotaxis. Methanol released by plants is oxidized to formaldehyde in the 
  periplasm by either MxaF (with its beta subunit, MxaI) or XoxF1 depending on the availability of Ln3+. MtpA localizes in the cytosol and presumably 
  recognizes formaldehyde as a ligand. MtpB is induced in the presence of Ln3+, and its activity is coupled with XoxF activity. MtpC is induced in the 
  absence of Ln3+, and its activity is coupled with MxaF activity directly or indirectly. The expression of MtpC and MxaF is regulated under the control of 
  MxbDM. The signals were integrated and transmitted to Che proteins that control the direction of flagellar rotation, resulting in methylotaxis and 
  successful cell gathering to plants.

  the cellular methanol oxidation and its product formaldehyde, 
  depending on which MDH is operating in response to the availability 
  of Ln3+. A schematic representation of possible methylotaxis 
  mechanisms in strain 22A is provided in Figure 6.
  Many kinds of plant-derived chemicals, including organic acids, 
  amino acids, phenolics, and sugars, support plant-associated 
  bacterial survival (Chaparro et  al., 2013). They have also been 
  identified as cues for bacteria chemotaxis to locate the plants (Feng 
  et al., 2018). Within such a wide variety of chemotaxis, we propose 
  that methylotaxis is one of the crucial steps for methylotrophs to 
  initiate symbiosis. Further investigation of ligand identification for 
  methylotaxis MCPs, the roles of many other sensors encoded in the 
  strain 22A genome, and the identification of other types of 
  methylotaxis sensors in the other Methylobacterium species will 
  contribute to revealing the eco-physiological and evolutionary 
  versatility of Methylobacterium species.
  Materials and methods
  Strains and culture conditions
  M. aquaticum strain 22A (FERM-BP11078, Tani et al., 2012) was 
  used for MCP identification. Other Methylobacterium type strains 
  were also tested for methylotaxis. Methylobacterium strains were 
  usually grown on R2A medium or mineral medium (MM; Alamgir 
  et al., 2015) containing 0.5% methanol or 0.5% succinate, or both. 
  Kanamycin (25 mg/L) and 1 μM LaCl3 were added when necessary. 
  For growth experiments, strain 22A and its derivatives were grown on 
  200 μl medium prepared in 96-well plates, which were rotary-shaken 
  at 300 rpm at 28°C. The growth was monitored by measuring optical 
  density at 600 nm using a microplate reader (PowerScan HT, DS 
  Pharma). MeOH-La and MeOH+La conditions refer to MM medium 
  containing 0.5% methanol in the absence and presence of 1 μM LaCl3, 
  respectively. E. coli DH5α was used for plasmid construction and 
  E. coli S17-1 was used for conjugation, and they were grown on 
  LB medium.
  Gene knockouts
  Gene knockout mutants for methanol dehydrogenases, that is, 
  ΔmxaF, ΔxoxF1, ΔxoxF1Sup and ΔmxaFΔxoxF1, and mxbD, 
  were generated in our previous studies (Masuda et  al., 2018; 
  Yanpirat et al., 2020). Gene knockout mutants for MCP genes were 
  generated using an allele-replacement vector pK18mobSacB, as 
  previously reported (Alamgir et  al., 2015). In brief, the gene 
  knockout vectors were constructed so that the vector contains 
  tandem ligated each approximately 1 kb upstream and downstream 
  regions of the gene to be  deleted, using the primers listed in 
  Supplementary Table S2 and the In-Fusion Cloning kit (Takara 
  Bio Co.). The vector was introduced into strain 22A via 
  conjugation using E. coli S17-1. Single-crossover mutants were 
  selected by kanamycin resistance, and double-crossover mutants 
  were selected by sucrose resistance. Polymerase chain reaction 
  diagnosis was carried out as described previously (Alamgir 
  et al., 2015).
  Chemotaxis assay
  The cells grown on solid medium overnight were collected with a 
  scraper, suspended in 2 to 3 ml of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (OD600 = 0.01) 
  in 15-ml tube, and incubated at 20°C for 2 h. Capillaries were made of 
  a glass capillary (with filament, model GD-1, Narishige), with a glass 
  puller (Narishige Model PC-10) so that the tip diameter becomes 10 
  to 20 μm. NuSieve GTG agarose (Lonza Bioscience, Co.) was dissolved 
  in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (15 mg/ml) at 50°C. Methanol (and other 
  substances) was added at the desired concentration (2% v/v or w/v, 
  otherwise stated) and the solution was kept at 50°C under seal. When 
  formaldehyde was used as a chemoattractant, 35 mg paraformaldehyde 
  was dissolved in 175 μl 10 mM HEPES pH 7.0 and incubated at 120°C 
  for 15 min, and the solution was regarded as 20% (w/v) formaldehyde. 
  The capillary tip was soaked in the solution for 5 s, and rinsed with 
  water. A sheet of FastWell™ (2 mm thickness, 20 mm diameter, Grace 
  Bio-Labs) was placed on a slide glass, and the 170 μl cell suspension 
  was pipetted into the well. The density of the cell suspension was 
  appropriately adjusted so that 50 to 100 cells are evident in the 
  microscopic window. A cover glass was placed offset, allowing a 
  capillary inserted between the FastWell and the cover glass. The 
  bacteria gathering at the capillary tip were monitored with a light 
  microscope (×200 magnification, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) for 3 or 
  5 min, and pictured every 30 or 60 s (308 × 256 μm, 1,024 × 768 pixels) 
  with a digital camera (VB-7010, Keyence). The cells in a frame were 
  counted with ImageJ software (Schneider et al., 2012). Automatic cell 
  counting was carried out with a macro containing the “Otsu” 
  thresholding and “analyze particles” command. The assay was done in 
  technical triplicates at least. The time-dependent gathering data were 
  used to determine the intensity (gathering speed) of chemotaxis by 
  measuring the slopes of the plots.
  Chemotaxis toward plant tissues
  The gathering and adhesion of strain 22A cells to rice or 
  Arabidopsis thaliana roots were assessed as follows in technical 
  triplicate. A. thaliana col-0 seeds were surface-sterilized with 70% 
  ethanol (2 min), 7% sodium hypochlorite containing 0.2% Triton 
  X-100 (8 min), and thorough washing with sterile water. The seeds 
  were allowed to germinate on 1/2 Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium in 
  square plates (14 cm × 10 cm) solidified with 1.2% agar at 23°C, for 
  20 days (12 h light/dark cycle). The plates were set vertically to allow 
  the roots to grow on the agar surface. The plants were removed, 
  weighed, and rinsed with 10 mM HEPES pH 7.0. The root part only 
  was soaked in 5 ml strain 22A cell suspension (OD600 = 0.01, 10 mM 
  HEPES, pH 7.0, pre-grown in MeOH-La condition for 2 days) 
  prepared in 6-well plates (1 plant/well). At appropriate intervals within 
  0 to 20 (or 60) min, the root was transferred into 1 ml HEPES buffer 
  in 1.5 ml tubes and homogenized with a pestle. The homogenates were 
  serially diluted with 10 mM HEPES pH 7.0, and 10 μl of the dilutes 
  were spread onto solid MM containing 0.5% methanol. The bacterial 
  colony forming units (CFUs) were determined after 5 days of 
  incubation at 28°C.
  The experiment using rice roots was carried out similarly. Rice 
  seeds were dehulled, soaked in 70% ethanol for 3 min, and incubated 
  in 3% sodium hypochlorite containing 0.5% tween 20 at 80°C for 
  30 min. The rice seeds (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) were put on 0.8%

  agar and allowed to grow at 28°C for 10 days. The excised rice roots 
  were incubated in bacterial cell suspension and transferred into 5 ml 
  HEPES containing 0.05% Sylwet (BioMedical Science, Tokyo) and 
  vigorously vortexed for 10 s to remove the cells.
  The density (CFU/ml) of the cell suspension (5 ml) was wild type 
  2.5 ± 0.63 × 105 and TM 3.2 ± 0.26 × 105 in the Arabidopsis experiment, 
  and wild type 2.0 ± 0.18 × 106 and TM 1.4 ± 0.21 × 106 in rice experiment.
  A young leaf of A. thaliana grown as above was excised and put 
  onto a slide glass, onto which strain 22A cell suspension was added. 
  The bacterial cells were observed under a stereo microscope 
  (Olympus MVX10).
  Quantification and observation of 
  mVenus-labeled cells on red perilla leaves
  The DNA fragment encoding mVenus protein was amplified by 
  polymerase chain reaction using pDAS2V (Takeya et al., 2018) as a 
  template and cloned into the EcoRI-digested pAT02m (Yanpirat et al., 
  2020) by the In-Fusion cloning kit. The plasmid, pAT02-V, was 
  introduced into strains 22A and TM by electroporation (2 kV, 25 μF, 
  200 Ω) using a Gene Pulser Xcell (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, 
  CA). Red perilla (Perilla frutescens crispa [Thunb.] Makino) seeds 
  were sterilized with 70% ethanol for 1 min, and with 1% sodium 
  hypochlorite (containing 0.3% Tween 20) for 1 min, then washed with 
  sterilized water 5 times. Strains 22A and TM were cultivated in MM 
  containing 0.5% methanol and 20 μg/ml kanamycin for 2 days at 28°C 
  and cells were collected, washed with sterilized water, and suspended 
  in sterilized water to obtain cell suspensions with OD610 of 0.1. The 
  sterilized red perilla seeds were soaked in the cell suspension of strains 
  22A or TM for 3 h with gentle shaking at 2 rpm using a Rotator RT-5 
  (Taitec, Saitama, Japan) at room temperature. The treated seeds were 
  sown onto Hoagland agar (culture dish, 100 mm × 40 mm, with porous 
  film seal) and aseptically grown in a chamber (NK Biotron LH-220S, 
  Nippon Medical and Chemical Instruments, Osaka, Japan) for 
  112 days. The system was operated at 25°C under a 16 h light and 8 h 
  dark cycle.
  Fresh leaves were removed from the perilla plants aseptically, put 
  into a 1.5 ml tube, and weighed. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was 
  added to the tube (100 μl/10 mg leaf) and vigorously mixed with a Vortex 
  mixer for 15 min. The 30 μl of suspension and 30 μl of AccuCheck 
  Counting Beads (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA) were added to 300 μl of 
  PBS, and mVenus-labeled cells were counted by flow cytometry 
  (FACSAria IIIu, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). For observation by 
  fluorescence microscopy, one fresh leaf was impressed onto a solid MM 
  containing 0.5% methanol and 20 μg/ml kanamycin for 1 min. After 
  removal of the leaf, the plates were incubated for several days at 28°C and 
  colonies were observed with a fluorescence stereo-microscope (Olympus 
  SZ16) equipped with a digital charge-coupled device camera (Olympus 
  DP80) and a YFP filter (Olympus SZX2-FYFPHQ).
  Promoter-reporter assay
  The polymerase chain reaction–generated DNA of the mtpC 
  promoter region (upstream non-coding region of the gene, 455 bp) was 
  cloned into the NcoI site on pAT06-Lux that is a promoter-less bacterial 
  luciferase reporter vector (Juma et al., 2022). The vector (pAT06-PmtpC) 
  was introduced into strain 22A derivatives via conjugation using E. coli 
  S17-1 and selected on kanamycin. The transformants were grown in 
  200 μl MM containing methanol or succinate or both, in the presence or 
  absence of LaCl3. The culture OD600 and luminescence were measured 
  with a microplate reader (PowerScan HT, DS Pharma). The promoter 
  activity was regarded as the luminescence / OD600 when the luminescence 
  reached a maximum during the cultivation.
  Cellular MCP localization analysis
  To observe the cellular localization of MCPs, mtpA (maq22A_
  c14925), mtpB (maq22A_1p32440), and mtpC (maq22A_c15300) 
  genes with their promoter region were cloned in tandem with the GFP 
  gene into the PstI site of pCM130KmC (Yanpirat et al., 2020) using the 
  In-Fusion technique and the primers listed in Supplementary Table S2 
  to generate pCM130KmC-MtpA (or MtpB and MtpC)-GFP. The 
  plasmids were transferred into strain 22A wild type or TM via 
  conjugation by E. coli S17-1 and grown on 0.5% methanol in MM for 
  1 day. The cells were subjected to confocal microscopic observation 
  (FV1000, Olympus). As a control, the GFP ORF fragment (without its 
  promoter) was cloned into pCM130KmC.
  Gene complementation
  The methylotaxis protein genes and their promoter regions were 
  each PCR-amplified with the primers listed in Supplementary Table S2, 
  and cloned into EcoRI site of pAT01 that enables His-tagged protein 
  expression in M. aquaticum strain 22A (Fujitani et  al., 2022). 
  We introduced termination codon in the 3′ primers to avoid possible 
  MCP activity interference by the tag. The vectors were each introduced 
  into TM, and the transformants were grown on methanol in the 
  presence and absence of LaCl3 and subjected to methylotaxis assay.
  Methylotaxis MCP homologs in 
  Methylobacterium genomes
  We sought MCP genes in the genomes of 62 Methylobacterium 
  type strains using 52 amino acid sequences of strain 22A MCPs by 
  BlastP (40% identity threshold). We found 1,467 MCP genes in total. 
  MCPs with more than 60% identity to strain 22A methylotaxis MCPs 
  were counted as methylotaxis MCP homologs.
  Statistical analysis
  The statistical analysis of data (Student’s t-test and analysis of 
  variance) was carried out using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., 
  CA, USA).

  ethylobacterium species are known as one of the predominant bacterial species that inhabit plant surfaces (1). Plants
  emit methanol as a product of pectin demethylation (2). The
  methylotrophic characteristics of the genus confer an advantage
  for survival in the phyllosphere (3). Some species have been reported to be capable of promoting plant growth (4, 5). Methylobacterium aquaticum strain 22A was isolated from a hydroponic
  culture sample of Racomitrium japonicum and shown to be a potent growth promoter for various plants (5). The strain belongs to
  a new lineage of the genus Methylobacterium, because its 16S
  rRNA gene sequence showed low homology with that of its closest
  type strain, M. aquaticum (98.506%) (6). The genome of strain
  22A was completely sequenced in this work.
  Genome sequencing of the fragment library (size, 900 bp; total,
  146 million bp; 316,194 reads) and paired-end library (size, 8 kbp;
  total, 69 million bp; 156,789 reads) was performed using the FLX
  454 genome sequencer. Additional sequencing data were obtained
  with an Illumina 500-bp paired-end library (117 million bp,
  816,704 reads). Assembly was done with Newbler version 3.0, resulting in 9 scaffolds with 134 contigs at 47 coverage. Gaps were
  closed in silico using GenoFinisher (7) and by sequencing of the
  PCR products bridging the scaffolds and contigs. Finally, the total
  genome size was found to be 7,557,960 bp (GC content, 69.1%),
  with a circular chromosome (5,348,274 bp; GC content, 71.1%)
  and ﬁve circular plasmids (i.e., pMaq22A-1, 1,571,989 bp [70.9%
  GC content]; pMaq22A-2, 462,889 bp [67.5% GC content];
  pMaq22A-3, 85,702 bp [67.8% GC content]; pMaq22A-4,
  50,170 bp [70.3% GC content]; and pMaq22A-5, 38,936 bp
  [66.72% GC content]).
  The identiﬁcation of protein-coding sequences (CDSs) and
  annotation were carried out using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome
  Annotation
  Pipeline
  (PGAP)
  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
  /genome/annotation_prok/) and the Microbial Genome Annotation Pipeline (MiGAP) (http://www.migap.org). The CDSs that
  were inconsistent between the two pipelines were manually corrected using GenomeMatcher (7). The predicted number of CDSs
  was 6,944. Ten rrn operons were found in the chromosome and
  one in pMaq22A-1. Eighty-three tRNA genes were found in the
  chromosome, and 12 were in pMaq22A-1. Thus, it may be possible to consider pMaq22A-1 the second chromosome.
  We identiﬁed almost all important genes encoding proteins
  involved in methylotrophy (8, 9): methanol dehydrogenases (MxaFI and XoxF), methylotrophy regulatory proteins (MxcQE and
  MxbDM), and PQQ synthesis enzymes (PqqA1A2BCDE, pqqA
  gene is duplicated, and PqqFG are encoded in distant loci). We
  also identiﬁed the genes important for interaction with plants:
  trans-zeatin production (miaA), cobalamin synthesis (cob),
  1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (acdS), siderophore production (rhbC), and ﬁve copies of ﬂagellin genes (ﬂaLabcde), but no nitrogenase gene. Nif genes were found in nitrogenﬁxing Methylobacterium nodulans and Methylobacterium populi
  (10, 11), which is consistent with the fact that this strain is not
  diazotrophic. The functions of these genes are under investigation. The genome information of the strain will allow both further
  functional and comparative genome analyses among the genus
  Methylobacterium and the establishment of a novel species to
  which the strain belongs to as a new lineage.

  numbers AP014704 to AP014709. The versions described in this

  Methylobacterium and Methylorubrum species are facultative methylotrophic bacteria
  that are abundant in the plant phyllosphere. They have two methanol dehydrogenases,
  MxaF and XoxF, which are dependent on either calcium or lanthanides (Lns),
  respectively. Lns exist as insoluble minerals in nature, and their solubilization and uptake
  require a siderophore-like substance (lanthanophore). Methylobacterium species have
  also been identiﬁed as plant growth-promoting bacteria although the actual mechanism
  has not been well-investigated. This study aimed to reveal the roles of siderophore in
  Methylobacterium aquaticum strain 22A in Ln uptake, bacterial physiology, and plant
  growth promotion. The strain 22A genome contains an eight-gene cluster encoding
  the staphyloferrin B-like (sbn) siderophore. We demonstrate that the sbn siderophore
  gene cluster is necessary for growth under low iron conditions and was complemented
  by supplementation with citrate or spent medium of the wild type or other strains
  of the genera. The siderophore exhibited adaptive features, including tolerance to
  oxidative and nitrosative stress, bioﬁlm formation, and heavy metal sequestration. The
  contribution of the siderophore to plant growth was shown by the repressive growth of
  duckweed treated with siderophore mutant under iron-limited conditions; however, the
  siderophore was dispensable for strain 22A to colonize the phyllosphere. Importantly, the
  siderophore mutant could not grow on methanol, but the siderophore could solubilize
  insoluble Ln oxide, suggesting its critical role in methylotrophy. We also identiﬁed TonBdependent receptors (TBDRs) for the siderophore–iron complex, iron citrate, and Ln,
  among 12 TBDRs in strain 22A. Analysis of the siderophore synthesis gene clusters
  and TBDR genes in Methylobacterium genomes revealed the existence of diverse types
  of siderophores and TBDRs. Methylorubrum species have an exclusive TBDR for Ln
  uptake that has been identiﬁed as LutH. Collectively, the results of this study provide
  insight into the importance of the sbn siderophore in Ln chelation, bacterial physiology,
  and the diversity of siderophore and TBDRs in Methylobacterium species.

  Methylobacterium aquaticum Lanthanophore/Siderophore
  INTRODUCTION
  Methylobacterium
  and
  Methylorubrum
  species
  are
  pinkpigmented bacteria capable of utilizing a variety of C1
  compounds (Vuilleumier et al., 2009). These bacteria can
  colonize a wide range of environments and are among the
  most abundant bacterial genera associated with the plant
  phyllosphere (Knief et al., 2010). Their phyllospheric abundance
  can be attributed to their methylotrophy and the presence
  of methanol, which is produced mainly as a byproduct of
  plant pectin metabolism during cell wall synthesis (Fall and
  Benson, 1996). The contribution of methanol to the colonization
  was demonstrated by the reduced colonization capability of
  methylotrophy-deﬁcient
  Methylorubrum
  extorquens
  strain
  AM1 mutants (Sy et al., 2005). Therefore, methylotrophy
  provides a selective advantage to the genus over other bacterial
  genera in the phyllosphere. Furthermore, the phyllosphere
  colonization by Methylobacterium species has been shown to
  vary with plant species, session, and growth stage (Omer et al.,
  2004). Methylobacterium species have also been identiﬁed as
  plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) (Tani et al., 2015;
  Yurimoto et al., 2021) that enhance plant abiotic stress tolerance
  (Kumar et al., 2019).
  Methylobacterium species have been extensively studied for
  methylotrophy in Gram-negative bacteria. Methanol is oxidized
  to formaldehyde by pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent
  methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs) (Anthony, 2004). Generally,
  MDHs are classiﬁed into two types, MxaF and XoxF, which
  utilize calcium and lanthanide (Ln) as cofactors, respectively
  (Keltjens et al., 2014). Ln acts as the transcriptional activator that
  induces the XoxF-MDH while repressing MxaF-MDH (Haque
  et al., 2015). XoxF-MDH is more commonly conserved among
  Methylobacterium species than MxaF-MDH, projecting Ln as an
  integral mineral for methylotrophy (Alessa et al., 2021).
  In nature, Ln occurs as mineral rocks that solubilize in
  sub-nanomolar concentration (Brown et al., 1990). Ln must
  be transported to the cytosol for Ln-dependent methanol
  metabolism to occur. A total of 10 genes, including TonBdependent receptor (TBDR) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-
  type transporter analogous to the siderophore-mediated iron
  transport system, have been identiﬁed in the traﬃcking of Ln
  in M. extorquens strain AM1 (Roszczenko-Jasi´nska et al., 2020).
  Based on the inevitable need to enhance the bioavailability
  of Ln and the similarity of Ln-iron uptake systems, an Ln
  chelator termed lanthanophore has been fronted. Recently, gene
  candidates for lanthanophore biosynthesis [lanthanide chelation
  cluster (LCC)] were identiﬁed in strain AM1. The LCC cluster
  resembled the genes for aerobactin synthesized in Grimontia
  hollisae. However, the LCC cluster does not encode a complete
  gene set for aerobactin synthesis. Therefore, the product of LCC
  lanthanophore should be chemically and structurally diﬀerent
  from aerobactin, although the chemically synthesized aerobactin
  siderophore was shown to bind Ln (Zytnick et al., 2022).
  Bacteria rely on siderophores to acquire iron. Siderophores
  are low-molecular-weight compounds (200–2,000 Da) with a
  high aﬃnity for iron (Ahmed and Holmström, 2014). They are
  structurally diverse and classiﬁed into three main families based
  on characteristic functional groups hydroxamate, catecholate,
  and hydroxycarboxylate (Sah and Singh, 2015). Siderophores also
  form stable complexes with other metal cations (Neubauer et al.,
  2000), sequester heavy metals (Chaturvedi et al., 2012), regulate
  oxidative stress (Adler et al., 2012), and provide antibacterial
  activity (Braun et al., 2009). Once iron is chelated, the complex
  is transported through a TBDR utilizing energy that is derived
  from the proton motive force and transmitted from the TonBExbB-ExbD proteins (Noinaj et al., 2010). TBDRs have also been
  reported to transport vitamin B12, saccharides, and aromatic
  compounds (Fujita et al., 2019).
  Siderophore production is one of the important bacterial
  functions in plant–bacteria and bacteria–bacteria interaction
  (Kramer et al., 2021); however, it has not been characterized well
  in Methylobacterium species and few strains in the genus have
  been reported to synthesize siderophores (Lacava et al., 2008).
  The recent ﬁnding of the aerobactin-like LCC gene cluster in
  strain AM1 showed that siderophores can play a critical role in
  Ln acquisition, which leads to the induction and activation of a
  novel enzyme, Ln-dependent XoxF-type MDHs. The mechanism
  for Ln-dependent expression switching (Ln-switch) between
  Ca2+-dependent MxaF and Ln-dependent XoxF is an important
  research topic in bacterial methylotrophy, and the elucidation of
  the siderophore function as lanthanophore is crucial to dissecting
  the molecular mechanism of Ln-switch.
  The genera Methylobacterium and Methylorubrum are diverse,
  comprising 63 species and categorized into three major clades,
  A, B, and C. Clade C has a diﬀerent methylotrophy gene
  repertoire, including a lack of mxaF in some strains, signifying
  the importance of the uptake of Ln in this group. This clade
  also has a diﬀerent set of genes for C1 compound metabolism,
  such as the glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase
  pathway (Yanpirat et al., 2020), and is characterized by a high GCrich genome (Alessa et al., 2021). Methylobacterium aquaticum
  strain 22A was isolated from Racomitrium japonicum (Tani et al.,
  2012). The strain belongs to clade C and its complete genome
  information is available (Tani et al., 2016). Strain 22A has plant
  growth promotion capability, although the mechanism has not
  yet been established. Siderophore is proposed to contribute to
  the plant growth promotion eﬀect. In this paper, we investigate
  the function of the staphyloferrin B-like siderophore from strain
  22A in plant growth promotion, bacterial physiology, and its
  involvement in methylotrophy. Furthermore, we aim to enhance

  RESULTS
  Gene Organization of Siderophore
  Synthesis Cluster in Strain 22A Genome
  The strain 22A genome contains a siderophore synthesis
  cluster
  composed
  of
  eight
  genes
  (Maq22A_c25425
  to
  Maq22A_c25465) with a similarity of 12% to the staphylobactin
  cluster (BGC0000943) according to anti-SMASH analysis.
  The strain 22A siderophore cluster, herein named sbnAH, also showed 33–56% identity to a well-characterized
  hydroxycarboxylate-type staphyloferrin B cluster (sbnA-I) from

  S. aureus (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1)
  (Cheung et al., 2009) and Ralstonia solanacearum (Bhatt and
  Denny, 2004). The N- and C-terminal portions of SbnF of
  strain 22A showed 34 and 33% similarity to sbnE and sbnF
  of S. aureus, respectively, suggesting that sbnE and sbnF are
  fused in strain 22A. Similar gene clusters were also found in six
  other Methylobacterium type strains in a non-taxonomy-speciﬁc
  manner. We hypothesized that the strain 22A sbn cluster
  synthesizes a staphyloferrin B-like siderophore.
  Staphyloferrin B is biosynthesized by the SbnA-SbnI encoded
  by sbn gene cluster in Staphylococcus aureus (Cheung et al., 2009).
  SbnA, SbnB, and SbnG generate L-diaminopropionic acid (LDAP), α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), and citrate, respectively, as the
  siderophore precursors. SbnE condenses citrate and L-DAP to
  citryl-DAP. SbnF condenses citryl-1,2-diaminoethane (DAE) and
  L-DAP to L-DAP-citryl-DAE. SbnC catalyzes the amide linking
  of the precursor and α-KG to produce staphyloferrin B (Cheung
  et al., 2009). The sbn cluster is also proposed to synthesize a noncharacterized siderophore staphylobactin, which is larger than
  staphyloferrin A or B by >300 Da (Dale et al., 2004).
  Characterization of Siderophore Mutants
  of Strain 22A
  The
  spent
  medium
  of
  strain
  22A
  was
  negative
  for
  catecholate and hydroxamate siderophore tests but positive
  for
  hydroxycarboxylate-type
  siderophore
  (Supplementary
  Figure 2A). Knockout mutants for sbnC and sbnF that were
  annotated as iucA/iucC family siderophore biosynthesis proteins
  were constructed to generate 1sbnC, 1sbnF, and 1sbnCF.
  Gene disruptants were also generated for the other individual
  sbn genes and a hypothetical gene (Maq22A_c25465) at the
  distal end of the cluster. Strain 22A wild type showed a positive
  reaction on chrome azurol S (CAS) agar plate, which is indicative
  of siderophore production whereas 1sbnA, 1sbnD, 1sbnF,
  1sbnH, and 1sbnCF were negative (Supplementary Figure 2B).
  The strain 22A sbn gene cluster contains two of the three
  iucA/iucC family genes (sbnC and sbnF) involved in many
  general non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-independent
  siderophore (NIS) biosynthesis. NIS biosynthesis utilizes at least
  one of these enzymes for siderophore synthesis as a crucial
  component (Challis, 2005). Due to this important potential
  role, we used 1sbnCF as a representative siderophore mutant
  throughout this study.
  The 1sbnC showed a reduced CAS reaction and a normal
  growth, whereas 1sbnA, 1sbnD, 1sbnA, 1sbnD, and 1sbnCF
  showed slower growth compared to the wild type, on succinate in
  the presence of 100 µM FeSO4 (Figure 1A). The wild-type spent
  medium complemented the growth of 1sbnCF (Figure 1B),
  suggesting the inability of the siderophore synthesis of 1sbnCF.
  Interestingly, 1sbnCF was able to grow on succinate in the
  presence of iron citrate (>50 µM) (Figure 1C). Furthermore,
  the combined supplementation of FeSO4 (50 µM) and citrate
  rescued 1sbnCF in a citrate concentration-dependent manner
  (Figure 1D). These results suggested that although the sbn
  siderophore contributes to the utilization of FeSO4, strain 22A
  has another mechanism to acquire iron citrate.
  We cloned the promoter region of sbnA (PsbnA, 644 bp) into
  pAT06, a promoter-reporter vector containing bacterial luciferase
  genes as a reporter and introduced it into strain 22A wild type.
  PsbnA showed high activity with 5 µM FeSO4 and low activity
  with 100 µM FeSO4 or the presence of iron citrate (Figure 2).
  This result suggested that sbn expression is induced by low iron
  availability and repressed by iron citrate.
  Siderophore Mediates the Interaction
  With Plants
  Although strain 22A has been identiﬁed as a potential PGPB
  in ﬁeld and pot conditions (Tani et al., 2015), the growth
  promotion mechanism has not yet been studied. We assessed the
  contribution of siderophore to this plant–bacterial interaction.
  We used duckweed (Lemna gibba p8L) as a plant model.
  Strain 22A wild type and 1sbnCF were inoculated into 1/2
  Murashige–Skoog (MS) medium under two iron regimes. The
  wild type and 1sbnCF showed no plant growth promotion under
  suﬃcient iron conditions (10 mg/l) (Figures 3A,B). In ironlimited conditions (1 mg/l), the wild-type strain 22A promoted
  duckweed growth, whereas 1sbnCF suppressed the plant growth.
  These results suggested that the growth promotion eﬀect is
  dependent on iron availability, and the siderophore is directly
  involved in its mechanism.
  The
  treated
  plants
  were
  subjected
  to
  iron
  content
  measurement
  with
  inductively
  coupled
  plasma
  mass
  spectrometry (ICP-MS). The plants in suﬃcient iron conditions
  contained almost constant iron levels irrespective of the
  genotypes of strain 22A (Figure 3C), suggesting that there was
  no competition for iron between the plants and the bacteria.
  In iron-limited conditions where the plants showed relatively
  smaller biomass, the plant iron content was increased by the
  presence of the wild type, suggesting that strain 22A assisted in
  iron acquisition in the plants. In the presence of 1sbnCF, the
  plants contained lower iron compared to the treatment with the
  wild type, and the 1sbnCF cells contained more iron than the
  wild type. These results suggested that the mutant competed with
  the plant for iron. Meanwhile, the bacterial cell mass assessed as
  wet weight in these conditions showed no diﬀerence between the
  wild type and 1sbnCF (Figure 3D).
  The growth promotion eﬀect by the wild type was also
  reproduced in Arabidopsis thaliana, under low iron conditions
  (1 mg/l) (Supplementary Figure 3A), suggesting that the iron
  dependency of the growth promotion eﬀect is not dependent
  on plant species. A. thaliana was inoculated with a rifampicinresistant strain 22A (22A-rif) and a kanamycin-resistant 1sbnCF
  (1sbnCF-km) individually or in co-inoculation under 1 mg/l
  FeSO4 (Supplementary Figure 3B). 1sbnCF-km colonized the
  plant phyllosphere better than 22A-rif in both conditions.
  These results suggested that 1sbnCF could acquire iron in the
  A. thaliana phyllosphere without the siderophore.

  and Ln-Dependent Methylotrophy

  24 h and quantiﬁcation of soluble La. We could detect a 24-folds
  higher amount of La in the wild-type spent medium compared
  to the non-inoculated medium and 1sbnCF spent medium
  (Figure 4A), suggesting that sbn siderophore is involved in Ln
  solubilization and chelation. We also conﬁrmed that >50 µM
  citrate solubilized La2O3 (Figure 4B).
  1mxaF can grow on methanol only in the presence of La3+,
  due to intact XoxF (Masuda et al., 2018). 1mxaF containing the
  PsbnA reporter vector was cultivated on succinate plus methanol
  under various concentrations of LaCl3 and FeSO4. The promoter
  activity was the control level in LaCl3 concentration in the range
  of 0.3–30 µM under both 5 and 50 µM FeSO4 (Figure 4C).
  A high concentration of LaCl3 (90 µM) activated PsbnA under
  5 µM but not under 50 µM FeSO4, suggesting that LaCl3 created
  iron scarcity, increasing the need for siderophore synthesis.

  circles, cell yield (OD600). The results were presented as the
  average ± standard deviation (SD) (biological triplicates).
  To further examine the involvement of siderophore in Ln
  solubilization, we generated 1mxaF1sbnCF. The wild type grew
  on methanol utilizing FeSO4 or iron citrate and either forms
  of La (LaCl3 or La2O3) (Figure 4D). Without the addition of
  an iron source, the wild type could not grow, however, La
  source omission did not aﬀect its growth (data not shown).
  1mxaF growth on methanol was dependent on either of the La
  forms and iron. 1sbnCF and 1mxaF1sbnCF could not grow
  on methanol in all conditions, even under a high concentration
  of iron citrate (100 µM) that could complement their growth
  on succinate (Figure 1C). We also found that 1mxaF1sbnCF
  was able to grow on methanol in the presence of LaCl3 and
  the wild-type spent media (Figure 4E) or with citrate (but not
  iron citrate) in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4F).
  These results suggested that siderophore is not required for
  methylotrophic growth in the presence of citrate, but that it serves
  as an Ln chelator in the absence of citrate, and that citrate also
  chelates Ln for uptake.
  We assessed the promoter activity of MDH genes (xoxF and
  mxaF) in the wild type and 1sbnCF grown on methanol plus
  succinate in the absence/presence of 30 µM LaCl3. The wild type
  showed a clear Ln-dependent switch of MDH gene expression
  (Figure 4G). In the presence of LaCl3, 1sbnCF showed more than
  10 times higher activity of PxoxF than the wild type. Judging from
  the diﬀerence in ﬁnal 1sbnCF cell yield between 0 and 30 µM
  LaCl3, 1sbnCF has methanol oxidation capacity in the presence
  of LaCl3, which means that La3+ uptake occurs by an unknown
  mechanism to activate XoxF. The reason for the high activity of
  PxoxF is unclear, but it is possible that sbn siderophore is involved
  in the maintenance of La3+ concentration in the cells, and the
  resultant high La3+ content in the cells resulted in high induction
  of xoxF.
  Role of Sbn Siderophore in Bioﬁlm
  Formation, Resistance to Reactive
  Oxygen Species, and Heavy Metals
  The bioﬁlm formation was inversely proportional to the medium
  iron concentration in the wild type, whereas supplementation

  with iron citrate resulted in bioﬁlm formation in a concentrationdependent manner in 1sbnCF (Supplementary Figure 4A).
  This result suggests that iron availability and siderophore
  production can inﬂuence bioﬁlm formation in strain 22A. We
  could not compare bioﬁlm formation without iron citrate since
  1sbnCF could not grow.
  1sbnCF was more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide (1 mM)
  and sodium nitrite (10 mM) but not to diamide (10 mM)
  compared to the wild type (Supplementary Figure 4B),
  suggesting that siderophore synthesis is involved in resistance to
  the oxidative stress.
  The growth of strain 22A and 1sbnCF in the presence
  of 50 µM iron citrate was not aﬀected by 10 µM ZnSO4,
  CuSO4, NiSO4, and MnSO4 (data not shown). The growth
  of 1sbnCF was inhibited by 100 µM ZnSO4, CuSO4, and
  NiSO4, but no signiﬁcant inhibition was seen on the wild-type
  strain (Figure 5A). Supplementation of wild-type spent media
  to 1sbnCF restored its growth under heavy metals. Higher iron
  concentration (100 µM iron citrate) also alleviated heavy metal
  toxicity in 1sbnCF. sbnA promoter activity in the wild type
  under 100 µM of each heavy metal and two iron concentration
  regimes was examined (Figure 5B). PsbnA showed a control-level
  activity under ZnSO4 and NiSO4, and repressed activity under
  CuSO4 and MnSO4 in the presence of 5 µM FeSO4. In the
  presence of 100 µM FeSO4, the promoter activity was generally
  repressed even in the presence of these metals, but not completely
  repressed in the presence of ZnSO4. The heavy metal content
  measurement revealed higher Zn accumulation and lower Ni
  accumulation in ZnSO4- and NiSO4-treated 1sbnCF compared
  to the wild type, respectively (Figure 5C). The cellular iron
  content in the absence of heavy metals was comparable between
  22A wild type and 1sbnCF when they were grown in the
  presence of iron citrate (Figure 5D). The addition of ZnSO4 or
  CuSO4 reduced, whereas the addition of MnSO4 increased, iron
  accumulation in both strains. The addition of NiSO4 resulted
  in iron accumulation that was similar to that of the control in
  both the wild type and 1sbnCF. Overall, these data suggested
  that sbn siderophore is involved in the heavy metal resistance of

  Variety of Siderophore Biosynthesis
  Clusters in Methylobacterium Species
  We found a total of 66 siderophore synthesis gene clusters
  among 60 genomes of Methylobacterium type strains and strain
  22A through anti-SMASH analysis (Supplementary Table 2).
  They had varied homology to known siderophore gene clusters
  (7–100%) and could be classiﬁed into 10 groups based on
  similarity. A total of 13 species were associated with two or
  more siderophore synthesis clusters. Most of the siderophore
  biosynthesis gene clusters were composed of 6–16 genes (data
  not shown). We found that 41 type strains were positive in
  the CAS agar assay. Although no gene cluster was identiﬁed in
  nine strains, seven of them were positive in the CAS agar assay.
  The malleobactin-like siderophore gene cluster was dominantly
  found in clades A, A1, and A5. The taiwachelin-like siderophore
  gene cluster was found in clade A4 and some members in clade B.
  Clades B2, C1, and C2 members have no dominant siderophore
  gene cluster, and only three species have a staphylobactin-like
  siderophore gene cluster in clade C1, to which M. aquaticum
  belongs. A total of 15 other siderophore gene clusters had
  no similarity to known clusters. Thus, siderophore synthesis
  is a common characteristic among Methylobacterium species,

  in phylogenetic clades.
  Co-inoculation of 58 Methylobacterium type strains with
  strain 22A 1sbnCF resulted in growth restoration by 21
  strains. Many of the positive strains have taiwachelin (8
  strains) or staphylobactin (6 strains), whereas strains containing
  malleobactin or ochrobactin were negative. Interestingly, only
  62% of the strains with taiwachelin-like siderophore could enable
  iron deﬁciency recovery. All ﬁve strains with an sbn cluster
  could complement the growth of 1sbnCF. R. solanacearum strain
  RS1000, which produces staphyloferrin B (Bhatt and Denny,
  2004), was also able to rescue 1sbnCF. The strains with an sbn
  cluster were all isolated from plants except for M. ajmalii strain
  IF7SW-B2T (Bijlani et al., 2021), implying the possible advantage
  of this type of siderophore in the plant-associated lifestyle.
  Characterization of TonB-Dependent
  Receptors in Strain 22A
  The strain 22A genome encodes 12 TBDRs, among which, those
  for iron-siderophore complex, iron citrate, and possible Lnlanthanophore should exist. We examined the phenotype of the
  gene disruption mutants or deletion mutants of these receptors in
  strain 22A. The 9 TBDR mutants not discussed here did not show
  any phenotypes in these assays.
  TonB-dependent receptor for sbn siderophore: A TBDR gene
  (Maq22A_c25420) was found in the upstream region of the sbn
  gene cluster and named tonB_sbn. 1tonB_sbn showed slower
  growth with FeSO4, and 1sbnCF1tonB_sbn could not grow on
  succinate with FeSO4 and wild-type spent medium (Figure 6A).
  Iron citrate supplementation rescued 1sbnCF1tonB_sbn growth
  (Figure 6B). These results indicated that tonB_sbn is involved in
  the sbn-siderophore-iron complex transport.
  TonB-dependent receptor for iron citrate: We found that
  a gene deletion mutant of Maq22A_c24885, herein named
  1tonB_cit, under a background of 1sbnCF, showed a lag
  phase when grown on succinate with iron citrate (Figure 6B).
  Supplementation of 50 µM citrate and 50 µM FeSO4 also resulted
  in a lag phase (Figure 6C). tonB_cit is therefore involved in iron
  citrate transport. However, the mutant could still grow. There
  may thus be another TBDR that can transport iron citrate or one
  for iron chelated by other substances.

  Maq22A_c14845 (labeled as 1tonB_Ln) under a 1mxaF

  The promoter region of tonB_Ln was cloned into pAT06, and
  the promoter activity in the wild type showed lower expression
  in a higher LaCl3 concentration (Figure 6E). This suggests
  that tonB_Ln is involved in Ln transport, and its expression is
  repressed when Ln is well available.
  Variety and Distribution of
  TonB-Dependent Receptors in
  Methylobacterium Genomes
  Using the sequences of the TBDRs in strain 22A and the TBDRs
  found in M. extorquens strain AM1 (LutH, META1p1785,
  and
  TonB_Lcc,
  META1p4129)
  as
  queries,
  we
  searched
  TBDRs encoded in all type strains of Methylobacterium and
  Methylorubrum species (Figure 7 and Supplementary Table 3).
  TBDRs found in the genera were phylogenetically classiﬁed into
  25 clusters, and each strain had 7–23 TBDRs in its genome.
  TonB_sbn is homologous to TonB_Lcc of strain AM1 and 52
  other TBDRs. TonB_Ln is phylogenetically close to strain AM1
  LutH and widely conserved with a total of 69 homologs in
  the genera; it is especially enriched in clades A4 and C1. LutH
  has only 10 homologs and is well conserved only in clade B
  (Methylorubrum species) and two clade A1 members. TonB_cit
  was also well conserved (40 homologous TBDRs), suggesting that
  the majority of Methylobacterium species can utilize iron citrate.
  TBDRs in strain 22A are phylogenetically diverse and each of
  them is widely conserved among Methylobacterium species.
  DISCUSSION
  The strain 22A sbn gene cluster showed 33–56% homology to
  sbn genes in S. aureus (Supplementary Table 1). The cluster
  lacks sbnI, whereas sbnE and sbnF are fused in strain 22A. We
  presumed that strain 22A siderophore has a similar structure to
  staphyloferrin B. 1sbnA, 1sbnD, 1sbnF, 1sbnH, and 1sbnCF
  but not 1sbnC showed defective growth on succinate under
  iron deﬁciency. Because SbnC catalyzes the critical ﬁnal step for
  staphyloferrin B synthesis, the intermediate(s) produced without
  SbnC may still be active for iron chelation. SbnF in strain 22A
  (the fused SbnE and SbnF) may be more important to synthesize
  the intermediates. This point will be clariﬁed when we determine
  the siderophore structure and the functions of each gene.
  1sbnCF could not grow well with FeSO4 (Figure 1A), and
  its growth was complemented by the spent medium of the
  wild type or iron citrate (Figures 1B,C). sbn gene expression is
  induced by low iron availability and repressed by iron citrate
  (Figure 2). Citrate has a lower aﬃnity (Kd < 0.260 nM) for iron

  than that of conventional siderophores (Fukushima et al., 2012)
  and acts as a general iron chelator for the bacterial community
  as opposed to individual siderophores (Mazoy et al., 1997).
  Therefore, strain 22A preferably utilizes iron citrate if available,
  without synthesizing sbn siderophore.
  The sbn siderophore of strain 22A is one of the plant
  growth promotion factors (Figure 3). Bacterial siderophore
  supplementation abolishes iron deﬁciency in plants (Crowley
  et al., 1992). Interestingly, 1sbnCF competed with plants for iron,
  which resulted in a low plant iron uptake. Because strain 22A
  can also utilize citrate as a carbon source, and citrate is one of
  the common organic acids in root exudates in response to iron
  deﬁciency (Ling et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 2015), we considered that
  1sbnCF overtook the iron complexed by plant-derived citrate.
  It should be noted that since iron citrate represses siderophore
  production, siderophore synthesis in the wild type precedes the
  plant citrate exudation, and the wild-type strain 22A did not
  become opportunistic. The growth promotion ability of strain
  22A was also observed in A. thaliana in low iron conditions
  (Supplementary Figure 3). The siderophore was not essential
  for strain 22A to colonize the A. thaliana phyllosphere, but in
  return, the plant growth was repressed. Judging from its iron
  accumulation, 1sbnCF can pirate iron citrate that is relatively
  abundant in the phyllosphere (Yokosho et al., 2009; RellánÁlvarez et al., 2010). On the other hand, siderophore synthesis
  was a biological cost in the wild type.
  We found that the sbn siderophore and citrate solubilize
  La2O3 (Figures 4A,B). The sbn siderophore was indispensable in
  the absence of citrate (Figures 4D,E) but was dispensable in the
  presence of citrate (not iron citrate) for XoxF- and Ln-dependent
  methylotrophic growth (Figure 4F). Thus, we concluded that
  the sbn siderophore is another type of “lanthanophore” involved
  in Ln uptake, in addition to the aerobactin-type siderophore in
  M. extorquens strain AM1 (Zytnick et al., 2022). Interestingly,
  sbn siderophore inactivation resulted in the overactivation of
  PxoxF in the presence of LaCl3 (Figure 4G). The expression of
  xoxF and mxaF is regulated by the Ln-switch; therefore, this xoxF
  overexpression indeed suppressed mxaF. It is generally accepted
  that siderophores play a role in the homeostasis of other metals
  other than iron. Most probably, the sbn siderophore plays a role

  not only in controlled Ln uptake but also in maintaining cellular
  Ln homeostasis. The siderophore-free La3+ in the periplasm
  might strongly induce XoxF through activation of MxbDM
  that is a two-component signaling system responsible for the
  expression of MDHs (Yanpirat et al., 2020). The exact reason
  for this high xoxF induction remains to be determined through
  investigation of the Ln-switch; however, here, we can add the sbntype lanthanophore as one of the factors involved in the complex
  switching mechanism.
  Iron concentration inversely impacted the bioﬁlm formation
  in strain 22A wild type. Access to a suﬃcient amount of
  iron could deter bioﬁlm formation since environmental stresses
  such as iron starvation generally trigger bioﬁlm formation
  (Muhammad et al., 2020). This corroborated with other studies
  showing that iron depletion enhanced bioﬁlm formation in
  diﬀerent bacteria including E. coli (Hancock et al., 2008)
  and Cupriavidus necator (Li et al., 2019). In contrast, bioﬁlm
  formation in 1sbnCF was enhanced with an increasing iron
  concentration (Supplementary Figure 4A). Iron is essential for
  bioﬁlm formation (Oliveira et al., 2017) and iron is a limiting
  growth factor for 1sbnCF at the tested iron citrate concentrations
  (Supplementary Figure 4A). The enhanced bioﬁlm formation
  in 1sbnCF by iron citrate suggested that iron acquisition rather
  than sbn siderophore per se was the important determinant.
  1sbnCF showed less tolerance to hydrogen peroxide and
  sodium nitrite (Supplementary Figure 4B), implying that this
  iron uptake system confers tolerance to oxidative stress. Iron
  is a dangerous metal due to its capacity to generate reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) through the Fenton reaction (Corpas
  et al., 2015). Therefore, iron homeostasis could be related to
  oxidative stress (Cornelis et al., 2011). SirA, a staphyloferrin
  B transport system, inﬂuences tolerance to ROS in S. aureus
  (Nobre and Saraiva, 2014). Whereas hydrogen peroxide increases
  intracellular hydroxyl radicals that lead to direct oxidation,
  diamide causes indirect oxidative stress by oxidizing glutathione
  (GSH) and furthering redox imbalance (Toledano et al., 2003).
  Therefore, iron mitigation by sbn siderophore could be ineﬀective
  for such an indirect oxidative stress mechanism.
  The sbn siderophore of strain 22A contributes to heavy metal
  resistance, and the results of the cellular metal accumulation and
  PsbnA activity analyses indicated that toxicity and siderophoremediated resistance mechanisms diﬀer depending on the metal
  species (Figure 5). The heavy metal toxicity was also inﬂuenced
  by the iron concentration. This suggested possibility of uptake
  competition among the metals. ZnSO4 treatment did not have an
  eﬀect on PsbnA activity, caused a high accumulation of Zn2+ in
  1sbnCF, and caused iron scarcity. The scarcity suggested that the
  sbn siderophore binds Zn2+, and hence, the siderophore prevents
  uncontrolled entry of Zn2+ into the cells (Braud et al., 2009).
  CuSO4 treatment repressed PsbnA activity, caused unchanged
  Cu2+ accumulation in the wild type and 1sbnCF, and decreased
  iron content in the wild type. Therefore, copper susceptibility of
  the mutant may include iron scarcity caused by PsbnA repression
  but not Cu2+ accumulation. NiSO4 treatment did not have an
  eﬀect on PsbnA activity and caused a higher accumulation of Ni2+
  in the wild type. Thus, Ni susceptibility of the mutant was not
  caused by Ni accumulation but rather by repressed iron transport
  that is necessary to overcome Ni toxicity. MnSO4 treatment at
  the tested concentration did not cause any growth inhibition in
  the wild type and 1sbnCF, suggesting that the sbn siderophore
  does not take part in the resistance. However, it caused decreased
  PsbnA activity, higher Mn, and iron accumulation in both cells.
  This contradictory decreased PsbnA activity and higher iron
  accumulation could not be explained well only with these
  data. These metals are essential mineral elements that exhibit
  important interactions and possible competitive inhibition of
  transport. The biochemical resistance mechanism in which the
  sbn siderophore participates awaits further characterization of
  the puriﬁed siderophore including its binding capacity and
  identiﬁcation of the transporters for each metal.
  Siderophore production is a common characteristic in
  Methylobacterium
  species
  bearing
  similarity
  and
  disparity
  among groups of individual strains (Supplementary Table 2).
  Malleobactin- and taiwachelin-type siderophore gene clusters
  may have been conserved through their evolution and phylogeny
  whereas the horizontal acquisition of the other siderophore gene
  clusters is dependent on their habitat as opposed to species
  evolution. Other strains of Methylobacterium species, as well
  as R. solanacearum with sbn genes and many taiwachelincontaining strains, were able to rescue 1sbnCF from iron
  starvation. Thus, strain 22A can utilize these xenosiderophores
  from Methylobacterium species and other non-methylotrophic
  bacteria. The diﬀerent types of siderophores and inter-species
  utilization among Methylobacterium species may contribute to
  the speciﬁc species predominance of the genus or even to
  shape the microbial community in diﬀerent niches, especially
  when Methylobacterium comprises one of the most predominant
  species in an environment, such as the phyllosphere.
  Among 12 TBDRs in strain 22A, here, we identiﬁed two
  TBDRs for iron uptake (Figure 6), which may enable the
  strain to more eﬃciently acquire either siderophore-bound or
  citrate-bound iron. The tonB_sbn is used for the uptake of sbn
  siderophore. On the other hand, tonB_cit is more eﬃcient in iron
  citrate uptake; however, another TBDR for iron citrate has not
  yet been identiﬁed. The tonB_Ln is necessary for Ln-dependent
  methylotrophy (Figure 6D). The expression of tonB_Ln was
  repressed with increased Ln concentration (Figure 6E). It
  remains unknown what form of Ln3+ is the substrate for
  tonB_Ln (sbn siderophore-bound Ln3+ or citrate-Ln3+) and
  whether tonB_sbn incorporates sbn siderophore-bound Ln3+
  or not. The Ln3+
  concentration-dependent repression of
  tonB_Ln, which was also found in tonB_LutH in strain AM1
  (Roszczenko-Jasi´nska et al., 2020), suggested that they have
  an Ln3+-sensing mechanism to optimize Ln3+ uptake through
  TBDR regulation.
  TonB_sbn, which is homologous to tonB_Lcc in strain
  AM1, was widely conserved among Methylobacterium species
  (Figure 7). The tonB_Ln and tonB_cit were also well conserved.
  Interestingly, tonB_LutH in strain AM1 was less conserved and
  found only in clade B (Methylorubrum species). The distribution
  of common or clade speciﬁc TBDRs may suggest the possibility
  of chelator sharing or competition among the Methylobacterium
  species. Other non-characterized TBDRs of strain 22A also
  showed a wide range of conservation within Methylobacterium

  ionophore will be intriguing.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS
  Microbial Strains and Culture Conditions
  The Methylobacterium species used in this study were grown and
  maintained on an R2A medium or mineral medium containing
  either 0.5% methanol or 0.5% succinate (herein referred to as
  methanol and succinate media), as previously described (Alessa
  et al., 2021). Kanamycin (25 mg/l), rifampicin (20 mg/l), LaCl3
  (30 µM), La2O3 (9 mg/l), FeSO4 (5–100 µM), and iron citrate (5
  or 100 µM) were added when necessary.
  The growth tests were conducted in 200 µl various medium
  prepared in 96-well plates, rotary-shaken at 300 rpm at 28◦C.
  The strains grown on R2A solid media supplemented with iron
  citrate were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 0.9%
  NaCl solution to make a cell suspension (OD600 = 1.0). The cell
  suspension was inoculated to a ﬁnal OD value of 0.02 in the test
  media condition. Growth was monitored by measuring OD600
  using a microplate reader (PowerScan HT, Sumitomo Dainippon
  Pharma, Osaka, Japan).
  The wild type strain 22A was grown in methanol media
  supplemented with 5 µM FeSO4 for 5 days. The cells were
  precipitated at 10,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant was
  ﬁltered using a 0.2-µm membrane ﬁlter. The spent media was
  stored at –20◦C until use. The target strains were grown on 10%
  wild-type spent media in the appropriate media.
  Detection of Siderophore
  Siderophore synthesis was assessed by chrome azurol S (CAS)
  agar assay for all the strains grown in modiﬁed succinate media.
  In brief, succinate media without Fe3+ was mixed with CAS as
  previously described (Louden et al., 2011). Diﬀerent methods
  were used to assess the types of siderophores. Arnow assay
  for catechol-type (Arnow, 1937): 50 µl of culture supernatant,
  50 µl of 0.5 M HCl, and 10 µl reagent (1 g/ml NaNO2 and
  1 g/ml Na2MoO4·2H2O) were mixed. After the formation of
  the yellow color, 90 µl of 0.1 M NaOH was added, resulting in
  the generation of red color. 1,2-dihydroxybenzene was used as a
  standard. Atkin assay for hydroxamate-type (Atkin et al., 1970):
  50 µl of culture supernatant was added to 50 µl of the Atkin
  reagent [0.177 g of Fe(ClO4)3 and 1.43 g HClO4 in 100 ml water].
  After 5 min at room temperature, the appearance of a winered color indicated the presence of hydroxamate siderophore.
  Salicylhydroxamic acid was used as a standard. Vogel test for
  hydroxycarboxylate (Vogel, 1957): the reagent was made by
  adding 20 µl of phenolphthalein to 60 µl of 1 M NaOH and
  topping up to 1 ml with water. In total, 50 µl of culture
  supernatant was mixed with 50 µl of reagent. The disappearance
  of color by the addition of culture supernatant indicated the
  presence of hydroxycarboxylate siderophore.
  Construction of Mutant Strains
  The
  primers
  used
  in
  this
  study
  are
  listed
  in
  Supplementary
  Table
  4.
  We
  generated
  gene
  deletion
  mutants of strain 22A siderophore synthesis gene cluster,
  1sbnC
  (Maq22A_c25435),
  1sbnF
  (Maq22A_c25445),
  and
  1sbnCF. Similarly, TBDR gene deletion mutants, tonB_cit
  (Maq22A_c24885) and tonB_Ln (Maq22A_c14845), were also
  generated in this study. These gene deletion mutants were
  generated using the allele-replacement vector pK18mobSacB,
  as previously described. Gene disruption mutants of other sbn
  genes (sbnA, sbnB, sbnD, sbnG, sbnH, and Maq22A_c25465) and
  TBDR genes (tonB_sbn (Maq22A_c25420), Maq22A_c06025,
  Maq22A_c08030,
  Maq22A_c21870,
  Maq22A_c22745,
  Maq22A_c22905,
  Maq22A_c27600,
  Maq22A_1p31685,
  Maq22A_1p34825, and Maq22A_1p38180) were also generated
  using pK18mobSacB. In brief, the approximately 600 bp midportion of the target gene was polymerase chain reaction
  (PCR)-ampliﬁed and cloned into the EcoRI site on the
  pK18mobSacB
  vector.
  The
  vectors
  were
  introduced
  into
  strain 22A via conjugation using Escherichia coli S17-1, and
  the kanamycin-resistant mutants were regarded as the gene
  disruption mutants. 1mxaF was generated in our previous study
  (Masuda et al., 2018).
  Construction of Promoter-Reporter
  Vector
  We developed pCM130KmC for general cloning purposes that
  operates in strain 22A from pCM130 (Addgene plasmid #45828,
  Marx and Lidstrom, 2001) in our previous study (Yanpirat et al.,
  2020). A fragment containing an EcoRI site and His-tag coding
  sequence generated by a pair of complementary oligonucleotides
  (pCM130KmCinsert1 and 2, Supplementary Table 3) was
  inserted into the EcoRI site of pCM130KmC with an In-Fusion
  Cloning kit to generate pAT01. Next, we also introduced bacterial
  luciferase (Lux) genes that are PCR-ampliﬁed from pUC18-miniTn7T-Gm-lux (Wehrmann et al., 2017) with LuxC-F and LuxER2 primers into pAT01 to construct a luciferase-reporter vector
  (pAT06-Lux). The PCR-generated promoter regions of sbnA,
  tonB_Ln, xoxF, and mxaF were cloned into the NcoI site on the
  pAT06-Lux vector. The vectors were introduced into strain 22A
  via conjugation using E. coli S17-1 and selected on kanamycin.
  To assess the promoter activity, cells of strain 22A and
  its derivatives transformed with pAT06-Lux containing an
  appropriate promoter were maintained on R2A supplemented
  with 25 mg/l Km. The cells were collected, washed with
  0.9% NaCl solution, and inoculated into appropriate media
  (succinate or methanol or methanol/succinate medium) at a
  ﬁnal concentration of OD600 = 0.02. The culture was replicated
  in white 96-well plates (for luminescence measurement) and
  transparent 96-well plates for bacteria growth assessment. The
  growth conditions were maintained as mentioned above. The
  maximum luminescence was normalized to cell density (OD600)
  and reported as promoter activity.

  Methylobacterium aquaticum Lanthanophore/Siderophore
  (1) Lanthanum uptake. Strain 22A wild type and 1sbnCF
  were grown on succinate-methanol media for 5 days, and their
  spent media was ﬁltered using a 0.2-µm membrane ﬁlter. The
  spent media or varied concentrations of citrate were incubated
  with La2O3 18 mg/l for 24 h at 28◦C under shaking at 300 rpm.
  The sample was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 min, at 25◦C) to
  remove La2O3, and 300 µl of the supernatant was dried at 80◦C
  overnight. The dry weight was measured, and the pellets were
  resuspended in 70% HNO3 and boiled at 100◦C for 1 h. Samples
  were diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 5% HNO3 and analyzed
  by ICP-MS (Agilent 7500cx). Strain 22A wild type, 1sbnCF,
  and 1mxaF1sbnCF were grown in 200 µl methanol medium
  containing La2O3/LaCl3 and iron citrate in 96-well plates. The
  plates were shaken at 28◦C at 300 rpm and the cell growth was
  monitored (OD600) using a microplate reader.
  (2) Oxidative and nitrosative stress resistance. Strain 22A
  wild type and 1sbnCF were inoculated in liquid R2A media
  containing 1 mM hydrogen peroxide, 10 mM sodium nitrite, or
  10 mM diamide and were incubated at 28◦C with continuous
  shaking at 300 rpm for 24 h in liquid R2A media. The samples
  were serial diluted and spread on solid R2A media containing
  100 µM iron citrate for 48 h. The colony-forming units (CFUs)
  per milliliter were evaluated, and the percentage of survival in
  comparison with the unchallenged treatment was calculated.
  (3) Heavy metal tolerance. Strain 22A wild type and 1sbnCF
  were grown in succinate media containing 100 µM of each
  heavy metal in 96-well plates and their growth was monitored
  by measuring OD600. For cellular metal content quantiﬁcation,
  they were grown on succinate in the presence of 25 µM
  of ZnSO4, CuSO4, NiSO4, and MnSO4 for 5 days. The cells
  were harvested and washed three times with phosphate-buﬀered
  saline (PBS) containing 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
  (EDTA) and then six times with PBS. Bacterial pellets were
  desiccated at 100◦C overnight. Thereafter, the samples were
  digested and analyzed with the ICP-MS as described above.
  Iron concentration-dependent heavy metal toxicity was also
  determined by culturing strain 22A and 1sbnCF in a varied
  concentration of iron and the heavy metals (50–100 µM).
  (4) Bioﬁlm assay. Bioﬁlm formation was studied by a modiﬁed
  method by O’Toole (2011). Strain 22A wild type and 1sbnCF
  were cultured in succinate media containing 25 to 100 µM
  FeSO4 and iron citrate prepared in 96-well plates at 28◦C for
  96 h. The content of each well was removed by decantation.
  The wells were then washed three times with PBS (pH 7.3),
  air-dried for 45 min, and stained with 0.1% w/v crystal violet
  solution (200 µl) for 10 min. After three times washing with
  water, 200 µl of 95% ethanol was added, and the absorbance was
  determined at 595 nm.
  Interaction of Strain 22A and Plants
  (1) Plant growth promotion by strain 22A: Single sterilized
  duckweed frond was grown in liquid (5 ml) half-strength
  Murashige and Skoog medium (1/2 MS) under a modiﬁed FeSO4
  concentration of 1 or 10 mg/l. The plants were subjected to
  inoculation of strain 22A wild type and 1sbnCF at a ﬁnal
  concentration of OD600 = 0.01 under aseptic conditions. Surface
  sterilized A. thaliana Col-0 seeds were grown on solid 1/2 MS
  and inoculated with the bacteria as described above. The plants
  were grown at 23◦C with a photoperiod of 16/8 h (light/dark).
  The experiments were conducted in triplicate. After 28 days, the
  plants were transferred into separate 1.5-ml tubes and bacterial
  cells in the media were pelleted at 4,000 × g for 4 min. The plant
  and bacterial cell fresh weight, dry weight, and metal contents
  were determined.
  (2) In planta colonization assay: A rifampicin-resistant
  spontaneous
  mutant
  of
  strain
  22A
  (strain
  22A-rif)
  and
  kanamycin-resistant 1sbnCF (1sbnCF-km) were generated as
  previously described (Alamgir et al., 2015). A. thaliana seeds were
  inoculated with the 5 µl (OD600 = 0.01) of the two strains singly
  or in combination and grown as described previously. A total of
  four seedlings were used for each experiment and replicated three
  times. Then, 5–10 leaves of A. thaliana plants not touching the
  media (200–300 mg fresh weight) were washed in 1.5-ml sterile
  tubes containing 1 ml 0.9% NaCl. Bacteria were dislodged from
  the leaf by shaking (5,000 rpm, 10 min) and sonication (34%
  amplitude, 20 s, Vibra cell, Sonics and Materials Inc.) followed by
  vortexing for 30 s. The resulting suspensions were serially diluted
  and plated onto R2A containing rifampicin or kanamycin for
  CFU determination.
  Characterization of TonB-Dependent
  Receptor in Strain 22A
  A total of 12 TBDRs in strain 22A were assessed for their
  role in iron-sbn siderophore uptake in 96-well plates. The
  mutant strains of the 12 TBDR in wild-type backgrounds were
  grown in succinate media supplemented with 100 µM FeSO4.
  Similarly, the mutants generated under 1sbnCF background
  were cultivated in succinate media supplemented with 50 µM
  FeSO4 and 10% wild-type spent media, or 100 µM iron citrate,
  or 50 µM FeSO4 and 50 µM citrate. The mutant strains of the 12
  TBDR with a background of 1mxaF were also generated to assess
  the TBDR for Ln uptake.
  Analysis of Siderophore Biosynthesis
  Clusters and TonB-Dependent Receptors
  in Methylobacterium Species
  A search for secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes was
  performed for the 60 Methylobacterium species genome to
  predict the siderophore gene cluster using AntiSMASH software
  (version 6.0.1 https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org) (Blin
  et al., 2019). Local BLASTp using the siderophore cluster and
  TBDR genes characterized in strain 22A and (META1p1785
  and META1p4129) in strain AM1 as queries was run against
  the non-redundant protein database of 59 Methylobacterium
  and
  Methylorubrum

  Siderophore Cross-Feeding
  1sbnCF cell suspension (OD600 = 0.01) in 0.75% agar was
  overlaid on solid succinate media. A sterilized paper disk (6 mm
  diameter) was placed on the plate, and the test siderophore donor
  strains were inoculated onto it. Colony formation of 1sbnCF
