title: METPO Chemical Utilization Extraction Template
description: >-
  A focused OntoGPT template for extracting organism-chemical utilization relationships from bacterial literature. Uses a two-step approach: first identifies chemicals mentioned in text, then extracts specific utilization relationships with METPO interaction predicates.

            Extract specific strain designations mentioned in the text. Include strain numbers, culture collection numbers, type strain designations, and isolate names. Examples: "15-1T", "ATCC 25922", "MG1655", "K-12", "strain ABC123", "isolate XYZ-1". Do not include general species names.

        range: ChemicalCompound
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            Identify all chemical compounds mentioned in the text that are relevant to bacterial metabolism, growth, or biochemical activities. Include: carbon sources (glucose, acetate), nitrogen sources (ammonia, nitrate), vitamins (B12, biotin), metabolic intermediates, enzyme substrates, electron acceptors/donors, and any other chemicals involved in bacterial physiology. If no relevant chemicals are mentioned,  leave this field completely empty. DO NOT include entries like "None  explicitly mentioned" or similar phrases.

        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            For each chemical compound found in chemicals_mentioned field above, extract structured relationships linking specific organisms to those chemical compounds. Generate tuples specifying the organism, the chemical, and the interaction type. Look for explicit statements like "X ferments glucose", "Y requires vitamin B12", "Z hydrolyzes starch", "degrades  cellulose", "oxidizes sulfur", "reduces nitrate", etc. Convert ALL  relevant chemical utilization patterns mentioned above into  organism-chemical relationships. If no chemical utilization relationships  are found, leave this field completely empty. DO NOT include entries like  "None explicitly mentioned" or similar phrases.

        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            A semicolon-separated list of strain-species relationships, where each  relationship connects a strain to its parent taxon. Each relationship should  have a strain name, relationship type, and parent species/genus. For example: "MG1655 strain_of Escherichia coli; K-12 strain_of Escherichia coli;  ATCC 25922 type_strain_of Klebsiella pneumoniae". If no strain relationships are found, leave this field empty.
