  {'content': 'Halomonas dongshanensis sp. nov., isolated from the seawater of Dongshan Island.\n\nA taxonomic study was carried out on strain yzlin-01T, isolated from Dongshan Island seawater. The bacterium was Gram-stain-negative, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative, rod-shaped, and motile by polar flagella. Growth was observed at temperatures of 10-40 °C, at salinities of 0.5-18 %, and at pH of 6-10. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain yzlin-01T belonged to the genus Halomonas, with the highest sequence similarity to Halomonas malpeensis YU-PRIM-29T (96.7 %), followed by Halomonas johnsoniae T68687T (96.4 %) and Halomonas gomseomensis M12T (96.4 %), and other species of the genus Halomonas (93.4-96.3 %). The ANI and digital DNA-DNA hybridization estimate values between strain yzlin-01T and the closest type strain Halomonas malpeensis YU-PRIM-29T were 77.44 and 21.6 %, respectively. The principal fatty acids were summed feature 8 (consisting of C18 : 1 ω7c and/or C18 : 1 ω6c; 55.7 %), C16 : 0 (20.6 %), C12 : 0 3-OH (6.8 %), summed feature 3 (consisting of C16 : 1 ω7c and/or C16 : 1 ω6c; 5.1 %). The G+C content of the chromosomal DNA was 60.0 mol %. The respiratory quinone was identified as Q-9 (100 %). Phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, aminophospholipid, and three unidentified phospholipids were present. Combined genotypic and phenotypic data suggest that strain yzlin-01T represents a novel species within the genus Halomonas, for which the name Halomonas dongshanensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain yzlin-01T (=GDMCC 1.3202T=KCTC 92467T).\n\nPMID:37170873', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
