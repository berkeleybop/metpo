Moeller media for the determination of ornithine and lysine decarboxylases and arginine dihydrolase are widely used in the United States.<i>Moellerella </i> (pronounced Mo-ler-ehl'-ah) is a modern Latin feminine noun formed by adding the diminutive ending "-ella" to the noun Moeller)</s></p><p class="description"><s><i>Moellerella </i> is proposed for the group of strains formerly referred to as enteric group 46.</s><s>Strain 2896-78 (ATCC 35017) is proposed as the type strain.</s><s>There is presently only one species in the genus, so the description for the species is the same. <i>M. wisconsensis</i> is the type species for this genus.</s><s>A complete description of <i>M. wisconsensis</i> is given in Tables 2 through 6. <i>M. wisconsensis</i> has the general characteristics of the family <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> (Table 2).</s><s>It can be differentiated from other <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> because it gives negative tests for indole, Voges-Proskauer, H<sub>2</sub>S production, urea, phenylalanine deaminase, lysine and ornithine decarboxylases, arginine dihydrolase, gas production from D-glucose, motility, and acid production from trehalose and positive tests for methyl red, citrate (Simmons), and acid production from lactose and raffinose (Table 6).</s><s>All strains were resistant (no zone of inhibition) to colistin (Table 5).</s><s>They were all susceptible to cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and nalidixic acid.</s><s>Only 22% were susceptble to ampicillin and carbenicillin.</s></p></content></protolog>
