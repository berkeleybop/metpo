Abstract:
Recently, it has been found that two types of methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs) exist in Gram-negative bacterial methylotrophs, calcium-dependent MxaFI-MDH and lanthanide-dependent XoxF-MDH and the latter is more widespread in bacterial genomes. We aimed to isolate and characterize lanthanide-dependent methylotrophs. The growth of strain La2-4<sup>T</sup> on methanol, which was isolated from rice rhizosphere soil, was strictly lanthanide dependent. Its 16S rRNA gene sequence showed only 93.4% identity to that of Methylophilus luteus Mim<sup>T</sup> , and the name Novimethylophilus kurashikiensis gen. nov. sp. nov. is proposed. Its draft genome (ca. 3.69 Mbp, G + C content 56.1 mol%) encodes 3579 putative CDSs and 84 tRNAs. The genome harbors five xoxFs but no mxaFI. XoxF4 was the major MDH in the cells grown on methanol and methylamine, evidenced by protein identification and quantitative PCR analysis. Methylamine dehydrogenase gene was absent in the La2-4<sup>T</sup> genome, while genes for the glutamate-mediated methylamine utilization pathway were detected. The genome also harbors those for the tetrahydromethanopterin and ribulose monophosphate pathways. Additionally, as known species, isolates of Burkholderia ambifaria, Cupriavidus necator and Dyadobacter endophyticus exhibited lanthanide dependent growth on methanol. Thus, lanthanide can be used as an essential growth factor for methylotrophic bacteria that do not harbor MxaFI-MDH.
