Abstract
The impact of periplasmic localisation on the functioning of the
XoxF protein was evaluated in the well-studied dichloromethaneutilising methylotroph Methylorubrum extorquens DM4, which
harbors only one paralogue of the xoxF gene. It was found that the
cytoplasmic targeting of XoxF by expression of the corresponding
gene without the sequence encoding the N-terminal signal peptide
does not impair the activation and lanthanide-dependent regulation
of the MxaFI-methanol dehydrogenase genes. Analysis of the
viability of ΔxoxF cells complemented with the full-length and
truncated xoxF gene also showed that the expression of
cytoplasmically targeted XoxF even increases the resistance to acids.
These results contradict the proposed function of the XoxF protein

as an extracytoplasmic signal sensor. At the same time, the
observed dynamics of growth with methanol, as well as with
dichloromethane of strains expressing cytoplasmic-targeted XoxF,
indicate the probable enzymatic activity of lanthanide-dependent
methanol dehydrogenase in this compartment. Herewith, the only
available substrate for this enzyme in cells growing with
dichloromethane was formaldehyde, which is produced during the
primary metabolism of the mentioned halogenated toxicant directly
in the cytosol. These findings suggest that the maturation of XoxFmethanol dehydrogenase may occur already in the cytoplasm, while
the factors changing affinity of this enzyme for formaldehyde are
apparently absent there. Together with the demonstrated
functioning of an enhancer-like upstream activating sequence in the
promoter region of the xoxF gene in M. extorquens DM4, the
obtained information enriches our understanding of the regulation,
synthesis and role of the XoxF protein.
