{'content': 'Mycolicibacterium cyprinidarum sp. nov., a rapidly growing species isolated from diseased koi carp, Cyprinus carpio.\n\nA rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacterium was isolated from diseased koi carp in Niigata, Japan, which was identified as representing a novel Mycolicibacterium species through whole genome sequence analysis. The bacterial isolates (NGTWS0302, NGTWS1803T and NGTWSNA01) were found to belong to the genus Mycolicibacterium through phylogenetic analysis using whole genome sequences of mycobacteria species. The bacterial colony was smooth, moist and non-chromogenic on 1% Ogawa medium at 30 °C. In biochemical characteristic tests, the bacterial isolates showed positive reactions for catalase activity, Tween 80 hydrolysis and tellurite reduction. The isolates were sensitive to 2-4 µg ml-1 ampicillin, kanamycin and rifampicin. Based on these results, we propose a novel Mycolicibacterium species, Mycolicibacterium cyprinidarum sp. nov. The type strain is NGTWS1803T (=JCM 35117T=ATCC TSD-289T).\n\nPMID:38809248', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
