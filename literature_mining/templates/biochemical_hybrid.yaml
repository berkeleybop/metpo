title: METPO Biochemical Extraction Template (Hybrid Optimized)
description: >-
  Optimized OntoGPT template for extracting metabolic biochemistry from bacterial
  literature. Applies hybrid optimization pattern (single consolidated field + inline
  examples + "Extract ALL") to maximize recall of enzyme activities, pathways, cofactors,
  and biochemical reactions.

            Extract ALL strain-biochemical relationships mentioned in the text. Be COMPREHENSIVE - do not omit relationships. Use EXACTLY the same strain identifiers from the strains field above.

            Include ALL biochemical relationship types:
            ENZYMES: 22A has_enzyme methanol dehydrogenase; AM1 expresses XoxF; MG1655 has_activity catalase
            PATHWAYS: 22A uses_pathway H4MPT pathway; AM1 employs serine cycle; MG1655 uses_pathway glycolysis
            COFACTORS: 22A requires_cofactor vitamin B12; AM1 uses_cofactor lanthanides; UTEX 2973 requires pyrroloquinoline quinone
            REACTIONS: 22A oxidizes methanol to formaldehyde; AM1 converts formaldehyde to formate; MG1655 reduces nitrate to nitrite
            GENE_EXPRESSION: 22A expresses mxaF; AM1 upregulates xoxF; MG1655 induces lac operon
            METABOLIC_CAPABILITIES: 22A methylotrophic; AM1 facultative methylotroph; MG1655 facultative anaerobe

            Extract BOTH what strains CAN do AND what they CANNOT do. Be thorough and capture all biochemical characteristics, enzymes, pathways, cofactors, and reactions described in the text.
          exclude: 22A, AM1, MG1655, UTEX 2973, methanol dehydrogenase, XoxF, catalase, H4MPT pathway, serine cycle, glycolysis, vitamin B12, lanthanides, pyrroloquinoline quinone, methanol, formaldehyde, formate, nitrate, nitrite, mxaF, xoxF, lac operon, methylotrophic, facultative methylotroph, facultative anaerobe
