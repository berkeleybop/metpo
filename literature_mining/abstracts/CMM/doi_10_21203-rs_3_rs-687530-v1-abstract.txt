Abstract:
<title>Abstract</title>  <p>A novel methylotrophic bacterium, strain Zm11 T , was isolated from reddish brown snow collected in a moor in Japan. Cells of the isolate were Gram-stain-negative, motile and rod-shaped (0.6-0.7×1.2-2.7 μm). Growth was observed at 5–32°C with an optimum growth temperature of 25–28°C. The pH range for growth was 5.4–7.8 with an optimum pH of 6.8. The strain utilized only methanol as carbon and energy sources for aerobic growth. The major cellular fatty acids (>40% of total) were summed feature 3 (C 16:1 ω 7 c and/or C 16:1 ω 6 c ) and C 16 : 0 . The predominant quinone was Q-8. The complete genome of strain Zm11 T is composed of a circular chromosome (2,800,413 bp), with G + C content of 46.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence and conserved proteins encoded in the genome. The results of analyses indicate that strain Zm11 T is a member of the family Methylophilaceae but does not belong to any existing genus. On the basis of its genomic and phenotypic properties, strain Zm11 T (= DSM111909 T = NBRC114766 T ) is proposed as the type strain of a new species in a new genus, Methyloradius palustris gen. nov., sp. nov.</p>
