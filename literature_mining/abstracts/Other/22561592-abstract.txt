{'content': 'Angustibacter peucedani sp. nov., isolated from rhizosphere soil.\n\nA strictly aerobic, Gram-stain-positive actinobacterial strain was isolated from a rhizosphere soil of a wild plant (Peucedanum japonicum Thumb.) collected on Mara Island, Jeju, Republic of Korea. Cells of strain RS-50(T) were oxidase-negative, catalase-positive, short rods and motile by means of a polar flagellum; the colonies were orange, circular, smooth and convex. meso-Diaminopimelic acid and glucose were the diagnostic diamino acid in the cell wall and the whole-cell sugar, respectively. The major menaquinone was MK-9(H(4)). The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, two unknown phospholipids and an unknown lipid. The major fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(16 : 0,) anteiso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0). The DNA G+C content was 73.6 mol%. In 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic trees, strain RS-50(T) formed a tight cluster with Angustibacter luteus (99.2 % sequence similarity); both were loosely related to the suborders Kineosporiineae and Micrococcineae. The DNA-DNA relatedness value of the isolate to A. luteus KACC 14249(T) was 22.3Â±0.9 %. On the basis of the results of phenotypic analyses and DNA-DNA hybridization experiments, strain RS-50(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Angustibacter, for which the name Angustibacter peucedani sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is RS-50(T) ( = KCTC 19628(T) = DSM 45329(T)). The description of the genus Angustibacter is emended.\n\nPMID:22561592', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
