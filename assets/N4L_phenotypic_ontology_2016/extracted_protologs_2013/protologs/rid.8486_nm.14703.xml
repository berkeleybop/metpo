L. masc. n. <em>lacus</em> lake; L. suff. n. -<em>cola</em> from <em>incola</em> the inhabitant; N.L. masc. n. <em>lacicola</em> inhabitant of lakes]. Represented by the aerobic, red-pigmented strain MWH-Ta8. This strain was isolated from the hypertrophic Mailing Bay, Lake Taihu, China. The strain is cultured as a mixed culture containing only a small fraction of betaproteobacteria, which were observed by FISH but did not appear as colonies on agar plates. Basis of assignment is the nucleic acid sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of strain MWH-Ta8 (GenBank accession no. AM182889) and the combined presence of the two oligonucleotide sequences 5′-CTTGCTCCGGTGGATTAGTGG-3′ (<em>E. coli</em> positions 83–105) and 5′-ACGACACCTTGGGGCATCCCAGGGTGTGGAA-3′ (<em>E. coli</em> positions 181–196) within the 16S rRNA gene. This diagnostic combination of oligonucleotide sequences is also present in two other cultivated strains, isolated from ponds in Australia (strain MWH-Aus1W7Actino) and subtropical China (strain MWH-SuzW20). All three cultivated strains share red pigmentation, small cells and a selenoid cell morphology. The diagnostic sequences are also present in ribosomal sequences of two uncultured actinobacteria, which were retrieved from running water in the north-eastern USA (Zwart <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Crump &#x0026; Hobbie, 2005). These five sequences form a cluster characterized by sequence similarities &#x003E;99.4 % (Supplementary Fig. S2). Furthermore, blast searches revealed the presence of the combined diagnostic oligonucleotide sequences in shorter partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of uncultured bacteria retrieved from Lake Taihu (Wu <em>et al.</em>, 2007), an urban freshwater creek in the USA and East African freshwater habitats populated by <em>Anopheles</em> spp. larvae. These partial sequences share sequence similarities &#x003E;99 % with the five almost full-length sequences presented in Supplementary Fig. S2.</s></p></content></protolog>
