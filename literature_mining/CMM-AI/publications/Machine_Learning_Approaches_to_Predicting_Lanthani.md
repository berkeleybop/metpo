Abstract:Deep generative models produce data
according to a learned representation, e.g. diffusion
models, through a process of approximation
computing possible samples. Approximation can be
understood as reconstruction and the large datasets
used to train models as sets of records in which we
represent the physical world with some data
structure (photographs, audio recordings,
manuscripts). During the process of reconstruction,
e.g., image frames develop each timestep towards a
textual input description. While moving forward in
time, frame sets are shaped according to learned
bias and their production, we argue here, can be
considered as going back in time; not by inspiration
on the backward diffusion process but
acknowledging culture is specifically marked in the
records. Futures of generative modelling, namely in
film and audiovisual arts, can benefit by dealing
with diffusion systems as a process to compute the

future by inevitably being tied to the past, if
acknowledging the records as to capture fields of
view at a specific time, and to correlate with our
own finite memory ideals. Models generating new
data distributions can target video production as
signal processors and by developing sequences
through timelines we ourselves also go back to
decade-old algorithmic and multi-track
methodologies revealing the actual predictive
failure of contemporary approaches to synthesis in
moving image, both as relevant to composition and
not explanatory.
