By ultrastructure, two morphological forms are observed, including larger reticulate cells and smaller forms with condensed protoplasm (dense-core forms) (Popov et al., 1998). Vectors, where known, are ticks. Organisms grow in tick vectors. Non-motile. Not cultivable in cell-free media or chicken embryos. Some species cultivable in blood monocytes, monocytic or macrophage cells lines, myelomonocytic cell lines, endothelial cell lines and tick cell lines. Aetiological agents of diseases of dogs and other canids, rodents and humans. Variably pathogenic or non-pathogenic infections in some ruminants such as deer and some rodents. The G+C content of the DNA varies between approximately 30 and 56 mol%. The type species is <i>Ehrlichia canis</i> (Donatien and Lestoquard 1935) Moshkovski 1945.</s></p></content></protolog>
