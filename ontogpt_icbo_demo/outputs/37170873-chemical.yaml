  Halomonas dongshanensis sp. nov., isolated from the seawater of Dongshan Island.

  A taxonomic study was carried out on strain yzlin-01T, isolated from Dongshan Island seawater. The bacterium was Gram-stain-negative, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative, rod-shaped, and motile by polar flagella. Growth was observed at temperatures of 10-40 °C, at salinities of 0.5-18 %, and at pH of 6-10. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain yzlin-01T belonged to the genus Halomonas, with the highest sequence similarity to Halomonas malpeensis YU-PRIM-29T (96.7 %), followed by Halomonas johnsoniae T68687T (96.4 %) and Halomonas gomseomensis M12T (96.4 %), and other species of the genus Halomonas (93.4-96.3 %). The ANI and digital DNA-DNA hybridization estimate values between strain yzlin-01T and the closest type strain Halomonas malpeensis YU-PRIM-29T were 77.44 and 21.6 %, respectively. The principal fatty acids were summed feature 8 (consisting of C18 : 1 ω7c and/or C18 : 1 ω6c; 55.7 %), C16 : 0 (20.6 %), C12 : 0 3-OH (6.8 %), summed feature 3 (consisting of C16 : 1 ω7c and/or C16 : 1 ω6c; 5.1 %). The G+C content of the chromosomal DNA was 60.0 mol %. The respiratory quinone was identified as Q-9 (100 %). Phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, aminophospholipid, and three unidentified phospholipids were present. Combined genotypic and phenotypic data suggest that strain yzlin-01T represents a novel species within the genus Halomonas, for which the name Halomonas dongshanensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain yzlin-01T (=GDMCC 1.3202T=KCTC 92467T).

Focus on strain numbers, culture collection codes, and isolate identifiers. Automatically remove terminal "T" or "(T)" suffixes as these indicate type strain status (e.g., "DA-C8T" becomes "DA-C8", "K13T" becomes "K13"). Include strain numbers, culture collection numbers, and isolate names, but NOT the full taxonomic context.>
  chemicals_mentioned: <Identify all chemical compounds mentioned in the text that are relevant to bacterial metabolism, growth, or biochemical activities. Include: carbon sources (glucose, acetate), nitrogen sources (ammonia, nitrate), vitamins (B12, biotin), metabolic intermediates, enzyme substrates, electron acceptors/donors, and any other chemicals involved in bacterial physiology. If no relevant chemicals are mentioned,  leave this field completely empty. DO NOT include entries like "None  explicitly mentioned" or similar phrases.>
  chemical_utilizations: <A semicolon-separated list of strain-chemical relationships. Use EXACTLY THE SAME strain identifiers from the strains field.
  Extract ALL relationships mentioned in the text. Be comprehensive - include both what strains CAN do and what they CANNOT do. Use specific predicates (uses_as_carbon_source, degrades, oxidizes) rather than generic ones when the text specifies the interaction type.>
  strain_relationships: <A semicolon-separated list of strain-species relationships, where each relationship connects a strain identifier to its parent taxon. CRITICAL: Use EXACTLY THE SAME strain identifiers as listed in the strains field above - copy them verbatim, character-for-character. Do not modify, abbreviate, or expand the strain identifiers. Each relationship should have the strain identifier, relationship type, and parent species/genus. For example: "DA-C8 type_strain_of Insulambacter thermoxylanivorax; MG1655 strain_of Escherichia coli; ATCC 25922 type_strain_of Klebsiella pneumoniae". The strain identifiers MUST be identical to those used in the strains and chemical_utilizations fields. If no strain relationships are found, leave this field empty. DO NOT write "none".>
