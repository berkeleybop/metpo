{'content': 'Complete Genome Sequence of Methylobacterium aquaticum Strain 22A, Isolated from Racomitrium japonicum Moss.\n\nMethylobacterium species colonize plant surfaces and utilize methanol emitted from plants. Methylobacterium aquaticum strain 22A was isolated from a hydroponic culture of a moss, Racomitrium japonicum, and is a potent plant growth promoter. The complete genome sequencing of the strain confirmed the presence of genes related to plant growth promotion and methylotrophy.\n\nPMID:25858842', 'saved_to': None, 'truncated': False}
