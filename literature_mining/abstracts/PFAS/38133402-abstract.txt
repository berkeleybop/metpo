Abstract:
The use of bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas-destructors of persistent pollutants for biotechnologies of environmental purification-is an interesting area of research. The aim of this work was to study the potential of Pseudomonas mosselii strain 5(3) isolated from pesticide-contaminated soil as a degrader of C7-C10 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and analyze its complete genome. The genome of the strain has been fully sequenced. It consists of a chromosome with a length of 5,676,241 b.p. and containing a total of 5134 genes, in particular, haloalkane dehalogenase gene (dhaA), haloacetate dehalogenase H-1 gene (dehH1), fluoride ion transporter gene (crcB) and alkanesulfonate monooxygenase gene (ssuE), responsible for the degradation of fluorinated compounds. The strain P. mosselii 5(3) for was cultivated for 7 days in a liquid medium with various C7-C10 PFCAs as the sole source of carbon and energy, and completely disposed of them. The results of LC-MS analysis showed that the transformation takes place due to perfluorohexanoic acid with the release of various levels of stoichiometry (depending on PFCA) of fluorine ion mineralization indicators determined by ion chromatography. Thus, Pseudomonas mosselii strain 5(3) demonstrates a genetically confirmed high potential for the decomposition of C7-C10 PFCA.
