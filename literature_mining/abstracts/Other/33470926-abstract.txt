{'content': 'Mannheimia pernigra sp. nov., isolated from bovine respiratory tract.\n\nOver a period of 1 year, 270 isolates identified as Taxon 39 of Bisgaard were obtained from the nasopharynx of veal calves at 11 epidemiologically independent Swiss fattening farms. Two isolates from each farm and the Australian Taxon 39 reference strain BNO311 were further characterized by genetic and phenotypic methods. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA and recN gene sequences placed the isolates in a single, distinct cluster within the genus Mannheimia. As to the rpoB gene, most isolates clustered together, but four strains formed a separate cluster close to Mannheimia varigena. Genome sequence analysis of isolates from both rpoB clusters confirmed their species status, with an average nucleotide identity (ANI) >98.9 % between isolates and <84 % to the closest species, M. varigena. Based upon whole genome sequences, the G+C content was determined as 39.1 mol%. Similarly, analysis of MALDI-TOF MS reference spectra clustered the isolates clearly separated from the other Mannheimia species, making this the method of choice for identification. In addition, numerous biochemical markers based on classical as well as commercial identification schemes were determined, allowing separation from other Mannheimia species and identification of the new taxon. Major fatty acids for strain 17CN0883T are C14 : 0, C16 : 0, C16 : 1 ω7c and C18 : 1 ω7c. Major respiratory quinones are ubiquinone-7 and ubiquinone-8. We propose the name Mannheimia pernigra sp. nov. for former Taxon 39 of Bisgaard. The type strain is 17CN0883T (=CCUG 74657T=DSM 111153T) isolated from a veal calf in Switzerland.\n\nPMID:33470926', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
