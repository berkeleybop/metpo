{'content': 'Reclassification of Paralactobacillus selangorensis Leisner et al. 2000 as Lactobacillus selangorensis comb. nov.\n\nThe taxonomic status of Paralactobacillus selangorensis is described and, based on evidence presented, transfer of the species to the genus Lactobacillus with the name Lactobacillus selangorensis comb. nov. is proposed. This reclassification is supported by multilocus sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and portions of the cpn60, pheS and rpoA genes. Mode of cell division and existing phenotypic information also show that P. selangorensis cannot be differentiated from the genus Lactobacillus. The type strain of Lactobacillus selangorensis comb. nov. is ATCC BAA-66(T) (=LMG 17710(T) =CIP 106482(T)).\n\nPMID:21296926', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
