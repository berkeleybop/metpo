{'content': 'Pusillimonas minor sp. nov., a novel member of the genus Pusillimonas isolated from activated sludge.\n\nA novel pale white-pigmented bacterial strain designated YC-7-48T was isolated from activated sludge in China. Cells of the strain, which grew at 15-37 °C (optimum at 30 °C) and pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum at 7.0), were Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped and motile. Strain YC-7-48T had 97.4-97.1% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to type strains of eight species in the genera Pusillimonas, Eoetvoesia, Paralcaligenes, Parapusillimonas and Paracandidimonas of the family Alcaligenaceae. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing placed the strain on a separate branch in the genus Pusillimonas and showed that it exhibited 97.4, 97.3 and 96.6% similarity to Pusillimonas caeni EBR-8-1T, Pusillimonas noertemannii BN9T and Pusillimonas maritima 17-4AT, respectively. The genome size of strain YC-7-48T was 3202438 bp, with 54.3 mol% G+C content. According to the genome analysis, YC-7-48T encodes several heavy metal resistance proteins and enzymes related to the metabolism of nicotine and aromatic compounds. The results of digital DNA-DNA hybridization and average nucleotide identity analyses based on whole genome sequences between strain YC-7-48T and the closely related strains indicated that the strain represented a new species of the genus Pusillimonas. The chemotaxonomic results identified Q-8 as the predominant respiratory quinone, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol and two unidentified aminolipids as the major polar lipids, and C16:0 (27.4 %), C17:0 cyclo (22.0 %), C18:0 (11.7 %) and C19:0 cyclo ω8c (9.5 %) as the major fatty acids. Thus, based on morphological, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic characterization and genomic data, we proposed that the isolate is a representative of a novel species named Pusillimonas minor sp. nov., with the type strain YC-7-48T (=CGMCC 1.17466T=KACC 21349T).\n\nPMID:35451948', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
