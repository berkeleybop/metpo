Abstract:
Four bacterial strains isolated from root nodules of soybean plants that had been inoculated with root-zone soil of either <i>Amphicarpaea bracteata</i> (Hog Peanut) or <i>Desmodium canadense</i> (Showy Tick Trefoil) growing in Canada, were previously characterized and placed in a novel lineage within the genus <i>Bradyrhizobium</i>. The taxonomic status of the novel strains was verified by genomic and phenotypic analyses. Phylogenetic analyses of individual and concatenated housekeeping gene sequences (<i>atp</i> <i>D</i>, <i>gln</i> <i>II</i>, <i>rec</i> <i>A</i>, <i>gyr</i> <i>B</i> and <i>rpo</i> <i>B</i>) placed all novel strains in a highly supported lineage distinct from named <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> species. Data for sequence similarities of concatenated housekeeping genes of novel strains relative to type strains of named species were consistent with the phylogenetic data. Average nucleotide identity values of genome sequences (84.5-93.7 %) were below the threshold value of 95-96 % for bacterial species circumscription. Close relatives to the novel strains are <i>Bradyrhizobium amphicarpaeae</i>, <i>Bradyrhizobium ottawaense</i> and <i>Bradyrhizobium shewense</i>. The complete genomes of strains 85S1MB<sup>T</sup> and 65S1MB consist of single chromosomes of size 7.04 and 7.13 Mbp, respectively. The genomes of both strains have a G+C content of 64.3 mol%. These strains lack a symbiosis island as well as key nodulation, nitrogen-fixation and photosystem genes. Data from various phenotypic tests including growth characteristics and carbon source utilization supported the sequence-based analyses. Based on the data presented here, the four strains represent a novel species for which the name <i>B</i> <i>radyrhizobium</i> <i>symbiodeficiens</i> sp. nov., is proposed, with 85S1MB<sup>T</sup> (=LMG 29937<sup>T</sup>=HAMBI 3684<sup>T</sup>) as the type strain.
