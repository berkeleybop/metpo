          semicolon-separated list of organism-compound relationships. 
          Extract every relationship where an organism:
          - ferments a compound
          - produces a compound
          - utilizes a compound  
          - reduces a compound
          - oxidizes a compound
          - metabolizes a compound
          - grows on a compound
          - contains a compound
          - does NOT ferment/utilize a compound
          - degrades, transforms, or converts a compound
          Format each as: "organism_name RELATIONSHIP_VERB compound_name"
