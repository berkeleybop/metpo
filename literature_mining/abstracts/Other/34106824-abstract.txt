Abstract:
Six bacterial strains isolated from root nodules of soybean plants that had been inoculated with root-zone soil of legumes native to Canada were previously characterized and 1) placed in two novel lineages within the genus <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> and 2) assigned to symbiovar septentrionale. Here we verified the taxonomic status of these strains using genomic and phenotypic analyses. Phylogenetic analyses of five protein encoding partial gene sequences as well as 52 full length ribosome protein subunit gene sequences confirmed placement of the novel strains in two highly supported lineages distinct from named <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> species. The highest average nucleotide identity values of strains representing these two lineages relative to type strains of closest relatives were 90.7 and 92.3% which is well below the threshold value for bacterial species circumscription. The genomes of representative strains 1S1<sup>T</sup>, 162S2 and 66S1MB<sup>T</sup> have sizes of 10598256, 10733150 and 9032145 bp with DNA G+C contents of 63.5, 63.4 and 63.8 mol%, respectively. These strains possess between one and three plasmids based on copy number of plasmid replication and segregation (<i>repABC</i>) genes. Novel strains also possess numerous insertion sequences, and, relative to reference strain <i>Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens</i> USDA110<sup>T</sup>, exhibit inversion and fragmentation of nodulation (<i>nod</i>) and nitrogen-fixation (<i>nif</i>) gene clusters. Phylogenetic analyses of <i>nodC</i> and <i>nifH</i> gene sequences confirmed placement of novel strains in a distinct lineage corresponding to symbiovar septentrionale. Data for morphological, physiological and symbiotic characteristics complement the sequence-based results. The data presented here support the description of two new species for which the names <i>Bradyrhizobium septentrionale</i> sp. nov. (sv. septentrionale) and <i>Bradyrhizobium quebecense</i> sp. nov. (sv. septentrionale) are proposed, with 1S1<sup>T</sup> (=LMG 29930<sup>T</sup>=HAMBI 3676<sup>T</sup>) and 66S1MB<sup>T</sup> (=LMG 31547<sup>T</sup>=HAMBI 3720<sup>T</sup>) as type strains, respectively.
