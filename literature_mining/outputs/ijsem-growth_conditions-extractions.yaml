  {'content': 'Flavobacterium tagetis sp. nov., a novel urea-hydrolysing bacterium isolated from the roots of Tagetes patula.\n\nA Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, motile by gliding, non-sporulating and strictly aerobic bacterium, designated strain GN10T, was isolated from the roots of Tagetes patula, collected from the garden of Dongguk University, Goyang, Republic of Korea. The cells could grow at 10-42 °C and at pH 5.5-9.0. Strain GN10T was sensitive to NaCl and tolerated up to 4 % NaCl (w/v). Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed the highest similarities to Flavobacterium tistrianum GB 56.1T (98.9 %), Flavobacterium sharifuzzamanii A7.6T (98.6 %), Flavobacterium zhairuonense A5.7T (98.3 %) and Flavobacterium anhuiense D3T (98 %). Phylogenetic analysis showed that strain GN10T clustered within the genus Flavobacterium and formed a monophyletic cluster with its close relative members. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain GN10T and related species belonging to the genus Flavobacterium were well below the standard threshold for prokaryotic species delineation. The DNA G+C content of strain GN10T was 33.6 mol%. The predominant cellular fatty acids (>10 %) were identified as iso-C15 : 0, C16 : 0 and summed feature 3 (C16 : 1 ω6c and/or C16 : 1 ω7c). Strain GN10T contained menaquinone 6 as the major respiratory quinone. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, three unidentified aminoglycolipids, two unidentified glycolipids, one unidentified phosphoglycolipid and five unidentified lipids. Urease is a nickel-containing enzyme found in archaea, bacteria, plants and unicellular eukaryotes. It serves as a virulence factor and is responsible for pathogenesis in humans and animals. Here, we describe a novel urease-hydrolysing bacterium, strain GN10T. The urease activity of this strain may serve as an indicator of pathogenic potential and drug resistance, which may facilitate the development of many diseases. The results of physiological and biochemical tests allowed the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain GN10T from its closely related members and considered to represent novel species in the genus Flavobacterium, for which the name Flavobacterium tagetis (GN10T=KCTC 82695T=NBRC 114841T) is proposed.\n\nPMID:34542390', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}

Cells were Gram-reaction-negative, oxidase- and catalase-positive, aerobic, motile with one polar flagellum and rod-shaped. The strain was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Strain THG-B283(T) grew optimally at around pH 7.0, at 25-28 °C and in the absence of NaCl on R2A agar. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain THG-B283(T) belongs to the family Sphingomonadaceae and is closely related to Sphingomonas melonis DAPP-PG 224(T) (98.2 %), S. aquatilis JSS7(T) (98.1 %), S. insulae DS-28(T) (97.6 %), S. mali IFO 15500(T) (97.1 %) and S. pruni IFO 15498(T) (97.0 %). Strain THG-B283(T) contained Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone. The major fatty acids included summed feature 3 (comprising C16 : 1ω7c and/or C16 : 1ω6c), C18 : 1ω7c, C14 : 0 2-OH and C16 : 0. The DNA G+C content was 72.2 mol%. The major component in the polyamine pattern was sym-homospermidine. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, sphingoglycolipid, diphosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified glycolipid, unidentified aminolipids, an unidentified phospholipid and unidentified lipids. Genomic and chemotaxonomic data supported the affiliation of strain THG-B283(T) to the genus Sphingomonas. DNA-DNA relatedness between strain THG-B283(T) and its closest phylogenetic neighbours was below 23 %. On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic and genetic data, strain THG-B283(T) represents a novel species of genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas kyungheensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is THG-B283(T) ( = KACC 16224(T) = LMG 26582(T)).\n\nPMID:23687058', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
