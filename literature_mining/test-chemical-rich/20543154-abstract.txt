{'content': 'Streptohalobacillus salinus gen. nov., sp. nov., a moderately halophilic, Gram-positive, facultative anaerobe isolated from subsurface saline soil.\n\nA Gram-stain-positive, rod-shaped, non-sporulating, motile and moderately halophilic bacterium, designated strain H96B60(T), was isolated from a saline soil sample of the Qaidam basin, China. The strain was facultatively anaerobic. Major end products formed from glucose fermentation were acetate, ethanol and lactic acid. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The isoprenoid quinone component was menaquinone-6 (MK-6). The predominant cellular fatty acids were C(16: 0), anteiso-C(13 : 0) and anteiso-C(15 : 0). The genomic DNA G+C content of strain H96B60(T) was 36.2 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on comparative 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain H96B60(T) represented a novel phyletic lineage within the family Bacillaceae and was related most closely to Halolactibacillus species (96.1-96.4 % similarity). Based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data presented, strain H96B60(T) is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Streptohalobacillus salinus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Streptohalobacillus salinus is H96B60(T) ( = DSM 22440(T) = CGMCC 1.7733(T)).\n\nPMID:20543154', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
