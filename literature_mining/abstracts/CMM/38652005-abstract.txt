{'content': 'Terrirubrum flagellatum gen. nov., sp. nov. of Terrirubraceae fam. nov. and Lichenibacterium dinghuense sp. nov. from forest soil and proposal of Rhodoblastaceae fam. nov.\n\nTwo Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterial strains, 7MK25T and 6Y81T, were isolated from forest soil of Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, Guangdong Province, PR China. Based on the results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain 7MK25T showed the highest similarity (93.6 %) to Methyloferula stellata AR4T, followed by Bosea thiooxidans DSM 9653T (93.3 %). Strain 6Y81T had the highest similarity of 97.9 % to Lichenibacterium minor RmlP026T, followed by Lichenibacterium ramalinae RmlP001T (97.2 %). Phylogenomic analysis using the UBCG and PhyloPhlAn methods consistently showed that strain 7MK25T formed a sister clade to Boseaceae, while strain 6Y81T formed an independent clade within the genus Lichenibacterium, both in the order Hyphomicrobiales. The digital DNA-DNA hybridization and average nucleotide identity values between strains 7MK25T, 6Y81T and their close relatives were in the ranges of 19.1-29.9 % and 72.5-85.5 %, respectively. The major fatty acids of 7MK25T were summed feature 8 (C18 : 1 ω7c/C18 : 1 ω6c), C19 : 0 cyclo ω8c, C16 : 0 and C17 : 0 cyclo, while those of 6Y81T were summed feature 8 (C18 : 1 ω7c/C18 : 1 ω6c), C16 : 0 and C16 : 0 3-OH. Strains 7MK25T and 6Y81T took diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine as their dominant polar lipids, and Q-10 as their major respiratory quinone. On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic data, strain 7MK25T is proposed to represent a novel species of a novel genus with name Terrirubrum flagellatum gen. nov., sp. nov., within a novel family Terrirubraceae fam. nov., with 7MK25T (=KCTC 62738T=GDMCC 1.1452T) as its type strain. Strain 6Y81T represents a novel species in the genus Lichenibacterium, for which the name Lichenibacterium dinghuense sp. nov. (type strain 6Y81T=KACC 21 727T=GDMCC 1.2176T) is proposed. Rhodoblastaceae fam. nov. with Rhodoblastus as the type genus is also proposed to solve the non-monophylectic problem of the family Roseiarcaceae.\n\nPMID:38652005', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
