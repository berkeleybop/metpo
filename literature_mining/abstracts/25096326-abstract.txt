Psychrobium conchae gen. nov., sp. nov., a psychrophilic marine bacterium isolated from the Iheya North hydrothermal field.

A novel psychrophilic, marine, bacterial strain designated BJ-1(T) was isolated from the Iheya North hydrothermal field in the Okinawa Trough off Japan. Cells were Gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, aerobic chemo-organotrophs and motile by means of a single polar flagellum. Growth occurred at temperatures below 16 °C, with the optimum between 9 and 12 °C. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that the closest relatives of strain BJ-1(T) were Shewanella denitrificans OS-217(T) (93.5% similarity), Shewanella profunda DSM 15900(T) (92.9%), Shewanella gaetbuli TF-27(T) (92.9%), Paraferrimonas sedimenticola Mok-106(T) (92.1%) and Ferrimonas kyonanensis Asr22-7(T) (91.7%). The major respiratory quinone was Q-8. The predominant fatty acids were C(16:1)ω7c and C(16:0). The G+C content of the novel strain was 40.5 mol%. Based on phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic evidence, it is proposed that strain BJ-1(T) represents a novel species in a new genus, for which the name Psychrobium conchae gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Psychrobium conchae is BJ-1(T) ( =JCM 30103(T) =DSM 28701(T)).
