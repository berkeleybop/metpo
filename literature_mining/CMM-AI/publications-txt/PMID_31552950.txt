Abstract
There is emerging interest in the role of lanthanides as cofactors for
XoxF-type methanol dehydrogenase (MDH). Here, classical
molecular dynamics simulations combined with fragment molecular
orbital calculations were employed to rationalize the enzymatic
activities of MDH (both XoxF- and MxaF-types) carrying different
lanthanides. In XoxF-type MDH, lanthanide binding to cofactor
pyrroloquinoline quinone was found to switch from tridentate to
unidentate fashion as it switches from lighter to heavier
lanthanides. This fact possibly plays a crucial role in the enzymatic
activity exclusive to XoxF-type MDH incorporating lighter
lanthanides.
