  Abstract:
  Artificial dye-coupled assays have been widely adopted as a rapid and convenient method to assess the activity of methanol dehydrogenases (MDH). Lanthanide(Ln)-dependent XoxF-MDHs are able to incorporate different lanthanides (Lns) in their active site. Dye-coupled assays showed that the earlier Lns exhibit a higher enzyme activity than the late Lns. Despite widespread use, there are limitations: oftentimes a pH of 9 and activators are required for the assay. Moreover, Ln-MDH variants are not obtained by isolation from the cells grown with the respective Ln, but by incubation of an apo-MDH with the Ln. Herein, we report the cultivation of Ln-dependent methanotroph Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV with nine different Lns, the isolation of the respective MDHs and the assessment of the enzyme activity using the dye-coupled assay. We compare these results with a protein-coupled assay using its physiological electron acceptor cytochrome c<sub>GJ</sub> (cyt c<sub>GJ</sub> ). Depending on the assay, two distinct trends are observed among the Ln series. The specific enzyme activity of La-, Ce- and Pr-MDH, as measured by the protein-coupled assay, exceeds that measured by the dye-coupled assay. This suggests that early Lns also have a positive effect on the interaction between XoxF-MDH and its cyt c<sub>GJ</sub> thereby increasing functional efficiency.

  Abstract:
  Only three biological pathways are known to produce oxygen: photosynthesis, chlorate respiration and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Here we present evidence for a fourth pathway, possibly of considerable geochemical and evolutionary importance. The pathway was discovered after metagenomic sequencing of an enrichment culture that couples anaerobic oxidation of methane with the reduction of nitrite to dinitrogen. The complete genome of the dominant bacterium, named 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera', was assembled. This apparently anaerobic, denitrifying bacterium encoded, transcribed and expressed the well-established aerobic pathway for methane oxidation, whereas it lacked known genes for dinitrogen production. Subsequent isotopic labelling indicated that 'M. oxyfera' bypassed the denitrification intermediate nitrous oxide by the conversion of two nitric oxide molecules to dinitrogen and oxygen, which was used to oxidize methane. These results extend our understanding of hydrocarbon degradation under anoxic conditions and explain the biochemical mechanism of a poorly understood freshwater methane sink. Because nitrogen oxides were already present on early Earth, our finding opens up the possibility that oxygen was available to microbial metabolism before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.

  Abstract:
  Methylomicrobium strains are widespread in saline environments. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z, a haloalkaliphilic methanotrophic bacterium, which will provide the basis for detailed characterization of the core pathways of both single-carbon metabolism and responses to osmotic and high-pH stresses. Final assembly of the genome sequence revealed that this bacterium contains a 128-kb plasmid, making M. alcaliphilum 20Z the first methanotrophic bacterium of known genome sequence for which a plasmid has been reported.
