Abstract:
We report the complete genome sequence of Corynebacterium casei LMG S-19264(T) (=DSM 44701(T)) which was isolated from the surface of an Irish farmhouse smear-ripened cheese. The genome of C. casei LMG S-19264(T) consists of three replicons: the chromosome (3,113,488 bp, 55.69% G+C content), the plasmid pCASE1 (2461 bp, 56.77% G+C content) and the plasmid pCASE2 (16,264 bp, 55.08% G+C content), encoding a total of 2908 protein coding genes. Analysis of the sequence data revealed a large region of ∼ 98 kb with an average G+C content of ∼ 65% that was acquired by horizontal gene transfer.
