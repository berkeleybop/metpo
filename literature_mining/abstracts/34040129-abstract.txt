Chryseobacterium schmidteae sp. nov. a novel bacterial species isolated from planarian Schmidtea mediterranea.

Marseille-P9602T is a Chryseobacterium-like strain that we isolated from planarian Schmidtea mediterranea and characterized by taxono-genomic approach. We found that Marseille-P9602T strain exhibits a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 98.76% with Chryseobacterium scophthalmum LMG 13028T strain, the closest phylogenetic neighbor. Marseille-P9602T strain was observed to be a yellowish-pigmented, Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium, growing in aerobic conditions and belonging to the Flavobacteriaceae family. The major fatty acids detected are 13-methyl-tetradecanoic acid (57%), 15-methylhexadecenoic acid (18%) and 12-methyl-tetradecanoic acid (8%). Marseille-P9602 strain size was found from genome assembly to be of 4,271,905 bp, with a 35.5% G + C content. The highest values obtained for Ortho-ANI and dDDH were 91.67% and 44.60%, respectively. Thus, hereby we unravel that Marseille-P9602 strain is sufficiently different from other closed related species and can be classified as a novel bacterial species, for which we propose the name of Chryseobacterium schmidteae sp. nov. Type strain is Marseille-P9602T (= CSUR P9602T = CECT 30295T).
