Abstract:
A Gram-positive, aerobic, non-motile, rod-shaped, spore-forming bacterium, designated Gsoil 139(T), was isolated from soil from a ginseng field in Pocheon Province, South Korea, and was characterized using a polyphasic approach. Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain Gsoil 139(T) belongs to the family Paenibacillaceae. The greatest sequence similarity was found with respect to the type strains of Paenibacillus hodogayensis (95.6 %) and Paenibacillus koleovorans (93.8 %). The strain showed less than 93.8 % sequence similarity with respect to other species of the genus Paenibacillus. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 48.1 mol%. In addition, the presence of MK-7 as the major menaquinone and C(15 : 0) anteiso as a major fatty acid (27.9 %) justifies its affiliation to the genus Paenibacillus. On the basis of its phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic distinctiveness, strain Gsoil 139(T) represents a novel species within the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus ginsengarvi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Gsoil 139(T) (=KCTC 13059(T) =DSM 18677(T)).
