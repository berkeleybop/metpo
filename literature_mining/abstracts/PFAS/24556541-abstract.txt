Abstract:
Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) is a compound of global concern because of its persistence and bioaccumulation in the environment. Nevertheless, little is known of the potential for PFOS biodegradation, even though the importance of characterizing the function and activity of microbial populations detected in the environment has been discussed. This study focused on the biodegradation of PFOS by a specific microorganism. Through this study, we have identified the aerobic microorganism for the specific decomposition of PFOS from wastewater treatment sludge, as a well-known sink for environmental PFOS. This species was Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain HJ4 with a 99% similarity, a mesophilic rod type bacteria (30-37°C). A pH range of 7-9 was determined to be optimal for the growth of strain HJ4. In this study approximately 67% over a range of concentrations (1400-1800μgL(-)(1)) for PFOS was biologically decomposed by P. aeruginosa after 48h incubation. This result is reported here for the first time, which strongly pertains to the efficient biodegradation of PFOS. Therefore, our study is considered a major advancement in sustainable PFOS treatment.
