title: METPO Chemical Utilization Extraction Template
description: >-
  A focused OntoGPT template for extracting organism-chemical utilization
  relationships from bacterial literature. Uses a two-step approach: first
  identifies chemicals mentioned in text, then extracts specific utilization
  relationships with METPO interaction predicates.

            Extract specific strain designations mentioned in the text. Include strain numbers, culture collection numbers, type strain designations, and isolate names. Examples: "15-1T", "ATCC 25922", "MG1655", "K-12", "strain ABC123", "isolate XYZ-1". Do not include general species names.

        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            Identify all chemical compounds mentioned in the text that are
            relevant to bacterial metabolism, growth, or biochemical activities.
            Include: carbon sources (glucose, acetate), nitrogen sources (ammonia,
            nitrate), vitamins (B12, biotin), metabolic intermediates, enzyme
            substrates, electron acceptors/donors, and any other chemicals
            involved in bacterial physiology. If no relevant chemicals are mentioned, 
            leave this field completely empty. DO NOT include entries like "None 
            explicitly mentioned" or similar phrases.

          List of specific organism-chemical utilization relationships with

        range: ChemicalUtilization
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            For each chemical compound found in chemicals_mentioned field above,
            extract structured relationships linking specific organisms to those
            chemical compounds. Generate tuples specifying the organism, the chemical,
            and the interaction type. Look for explicit statements like "X ferments
            glucose", "Y requires vitamin B12", "Z hydrolyzes starch", "degrades 
            cellulose", "oxidizes sulfur", "reduces nitrate", etc. Convert ALL 
            relevant chemical utilization patterns mentioned above into 
            organism-chemical relationships. If no chemical utilization relationships 
            are found, leave this field completely empty. DO NOT include entries like 
            "None explicitly mentioned" or similar phrases.
      strain_relationships:
        description: >-
          semicolon-separated list of strain-species relationships found in the text
        multivalued: true
        range: StrainRelationship
        annotations:
          prompt: >-
            A semicolon-separated list of strain-species relationships, where each 
            relationship connects a strain to its parent taxon. Each relationship should 
            have a strain name, relationship type, and parent species/genus.
            For example: "MG1655 strain_of Escherichia coli; K-12 strain_of Escherichia coli; 
            ATCC 25922 type_strain_of Klebsiella pneumoniae". If no strain relationships are found, leave this field empty.
