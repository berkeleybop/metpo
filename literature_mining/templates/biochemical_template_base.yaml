          prompt: >-
            For each enzyme activity, API test result, and metabolic test found in the fields above, extract structured relationships linking specific strains to those biochemical characteristics. Generate tuples like "strain 15-1T positive_for catalase", "ATCC 25922 negative_for oxidase", "isolate XYZ-1 demonstrates_activity gelatinase", "strain ABC123 positive_for β-galactosidase", "strain 123T positive_for API 20E", "ATCC 14887 negative_for methyl red". Convert ALL biochemical tests and enzyme activities mentioned above into strain-biochemical relationships.

          prompt: >-
            A semicolon-separated list of strain-species relationships, where each 
            relationship connects a strain to its parent taxon. Each relationship should 
            have a strain name, relationship type, and parent species/genus.
