{'content': 'Paraglaciecola aestuariivivens sp. nov., isolated from a tidal flat.\n\nA Gram-stain-negative, singly flagellated, aerobic and coccoid, ovoid or rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain JDTF-33T, was isolated from a tidal flat in Jindo, an island of South Korea. Strain JDTF-33T grew optimally at 30 °C, at pH 7.0-8.0 and in the presence of 2.0-3.0 % (w/v) NaCl. A neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, demonstrated that strain JDTF-33T belonged to the genus Paraglaciecola, joining the type strain of the species Paraglaciecola aquimarinawith 97.9 % sequence similarity. Strain JDTF-33T exhibited 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 97.1 and 97.0 % to the type strains of Paraglaciecola arctica and Paraglaciecola psychrophila, respectively, and of 96.1-96.6 % to the type strains of the other species of the genus Paraglaciecola. Strain JDTF-33T showed DNA-DNA relatedness values of 11-24 % to the type strains of the species P. aquimarina, P. arctica and Paraglaciecola psychrophila. Strain JDTF-33T contained Q-8 as the predominant ubiquinone and summed feature 3 (C16 : ω7c and/or C16 : 1ω6c) and C16 : 0 as the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids detected in strain JDTF-33T were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. The DNA G+C content of strain JDTF-33T was 41.7 mol%. Differential phenotypic properties, together with phylogenetic and genetic data, demonstrate that strain JDTF-33T is separate from species of the genus Paraglaciecolawith validly published names. On the basis of the data presented, strain JDTF-33T represents a novel species of the genus Paraglaciecola, for which the name Paraglaciecola aestuariivivens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JDTF-33T (=KCTC 52838T=NBRC 112782T).\n\nPMID:28984552', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
