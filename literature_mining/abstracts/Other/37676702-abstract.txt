{'content': 'Penicillium rhizophilum, a novel species in the section Exilicaulis isolated from the rhizosphere of sugarcane in Southwest Iran.\n\nDuring a survey of species diversity of Penicillium and Talaromyces in sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) rhizosphere in the Khuzestan province of Iran [1], 195 strains were examined, from which 187 belonged to Penicillium (11 species) and eight to Talaromyces (one species). In the present study, three strains of Penicillium belonging to section Exilicaulis series Restricta, identified as P. restrictum by Ansari et al. [1], were subjected to a phylogenetic study. The multilocus phylogeny of partial Î²-tubulin, calmodulin and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit genes enabled the recognition of one new phylogenetic species that is here formally described as Penicillium rhizophilum sp. nov. This species is phylogenetically distinct in series Restricta, but it does not show significant morphological differences from other species previously classified in the series. Therefore, we here placed bias on the phylogenetic species concept. The holotype of Penicillium rhizophilum sp. nov. is IRAN 18169F and the ex-type culture is LA30T (=IRAN 4042CT=CBS 149737T).\n\nPMID:37676702', 'saved_to': None, 'windowed': False}
